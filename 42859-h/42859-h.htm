<h2><i>The</i> RANI <i>of</i> JHANSI</h2>

<p>"Being young, vigorous, and not afraid to show herself
to the multitude, she gained a great influence over
the hearts of the people. It was this influence, this force
of character, added to a splendid and inspiring courage,
that enabled her to offer a desperate resistance to the
British.... Whatever her faults in British eyes
may have been, her countrymen will ever believe that she
was driven by ill-treatment into rebellion; that her cause
was a righteous cause. To them she will always be a
heroine."</p>

<h2>LACHMI BAI</h2>

<hr class="tb" />

<h2>Chapter I<br />
<i>BEFORE THE STORM</i></h2>


<p>It was a day of angry, torrid heat. The June sun
of Central India blazed fiercely upon an uneven
plain, upon a river winding to the northward, a
lake bordered by trees, and upon the walled city
of Jhansi with its rock fortress rising precipitously to
guard the western front. Beneath the south wall, amid
groves of acacia, whose parched and dust-coated limbs
seemed to implore a speedy descent of the rains then due,
were discernible the white domes of temples and tombs.
A little further away, surrounded by gardens, were
situated the bungalows of the Foreign residents, the cantonments
of their troops, and the Star Fort containing
their treasure and arms.</p>

<p>The hour of noon approached. Over all a reposeful
silence reigned. Everyone had sought the shelter of cool
halls and darkened chambers. In the fort and cantonments
the soldiers had been dismissed from their duties;
on the roads leading to the city there was little traffic;
within the gates the bazaars were deserted; not a dog
even ventured upon the blistering stones of the palace
courtyard. Only in the shadow of a pillar near the main
entrance to that turreted structure, a blind beggar sat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
every now and then raising his monotonous cry for pity
and alms.</p>

<p>Externally, an indefinite era of peace seemed to have
settled upon Jhansi. Except for the periodical anxiety
concerning the rains, there appeared to be no disquieting
feature disturbing its outward calm. Yet for months
past in that year of 1857 a token,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> a warning of some
great impending occurrence had gone forth through the
land; from whence proceeding few men knew, to what
purpose the masses did not comprehend, though they
watched. With indifference as to what it might portend,
the Foreigners had also observed the sign.</p>

<p>But in one place in Jhansi that day there was no rest
at the noontide hour. It was in the palace of the disinherited
Rani, or Princess of the state. There, an atmosphere
of suspense, an air laden with that mysterious foreboding
that some mighty event was about to take place,
permeated every apartment, the halls, courts, and corridors.
The very walls seemed to live with sinister animation.
Men, many of them with arms displayed openly,
moved stealthily back and forth from room to room,
gathering in groups to discuss some weighty topic with
hushed accents. Even the women servants appeared to
have caught the infection of the hour, pausing to glean
snatches of the men's conversation, and passing on with
significant looks.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>In a small enclosed garden of the palace, where palms,
bright-leaved crotons, and fragrant blossoms, afforded a
refreshing retreat from the atmospherical furnace without,
a man and woman paced side by side in earnest
discourse. The man was tall, bronze-visaged, and of martial
bearing; the woman slender in form, graceful in
carriage, and beautiful in so far as one might gather
from features partly concealed by a fold of her embroidered
<i>chuddah</i>. The former was a Mohammedan noble,
Ahmad Khan; the latter, Lachmi Bai, the disinherited
Rani of Jhansi.</p>

<p>At a turn in their walk the Princess turned to confront
her companion.</p>

<p>"You say, my Lord," she spoke quickly, "that Bahadur
Shah once more reigns supreme in Delhi; that the
troops at Aligurth have marched out to join his standard;
that Bareli has fallen into the hands of Khan Bahadur
Khan; and yet there is no news from Bithur. When,
in Heaven's name, is Dundhu Panth, the Peshwa, going
to send us the signal to rise in Jhansi? For a month past
my people have impatiently strained on the leash, awaiting
my word to rush forth and drive the Foreigners from
the State. I cannot&mdash;nay I cannot hold them in hand
much longer. God knows, they have their own wrongs
as well as mine to redress."</p>

<p>Ahmad raised a hand restrainingly.</p>

<p>"Patience! Patience! my Lady Rani," he exclaimed.
"In a little, to-day, to-morrow, surely the Peshwa's
messenger will arrive. Restraint will be for the best in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the end. The arm of your people will strike all the
harder; their onset will be the more irresistible."</p>

<p>"Aye, truly," she replied, "but you forget, O Ahmad,
that the Foreigners will not sleep forever. The news
from Delhi must have reached their ears. A single
traitor might cause them to awake, defeating all our
plans. I fear that the blow upon which we have
staked so much, may yet fall without cleaving to the
heart."</p>

<p>A Native officer in Foreign uniform entered the garden.
He halted and saluted.</p>

<p>The Rani and her companion turned quickly toward
him with expressions of sudden alarm.</p>

<p>The officer advanced to deliver a message.</p>

<p>"Your Highness," he began, addressing the Rani.
"The Commissioner and Captain Sahibs will shortly arrive
at the palace to seek an audience. I have been sent
forward to acquaint you of their visit."</p>

<p>The Rani stepped close to the officer and scrutinized
his features. Then she grasped him tightly by the sleeve
of his jacket.</p>

<p>"Thou art the Jamadar Golab Das"? she interrogated.</p>

<p>"As thou sayest, noble Rani."</p>

<p>"Tell me, O Golab," she besought anxiously. "Have
they heard? Have the eyes of the Foreigners been
opened? Hath a traitor whispered in their ears"?</p>

<p>"They sleep on, all thy people are faithful," the officer
returned significantly.</p>

<p>A sigh of relief escaped the Rani's lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is well," she exclaimed. "Then I will see the
Foreign Sahibs. Go, carry them that message."</p>

<p>The officer again saluted and left her presence.</p>

<p>As if a sudden inspiration had gained possession of the
Rani's mind, she turned to Ahmad and spoke authoritatively.</p>

<p>"It is my will to see the Foreign Sahibs alone in the
<i>Darbar</i> hall."</p>

<p>He made a gesture as if about to protest against her
purpose.</p>

<p>"Nay," she continued, "Nay, good Ahmad. It is the
best plan. If they see me unattended they will be less
suspicious. Go, order everyone to hide from view. Let
not a face be seen or a voice heard. Let these walls be
as silent as a tomb&mdash;aye even as the tomb that these
Foreigners have built about my life, depriving me of
what was justly mine. The palace sleeps, they will say.
This woman can do no harm."</p>

<p>She gracefully recognized the Mohammedan noble's
bow, signifying his compliance to her order, and moved
quickly to a door leading to her private apartments.</p>

<p>At the southern gate of the city, the two Foreign
Sahibs, attended by a Native orderly, were met by Golab
Das, bearing the Rani's reply.</p>

<p>"Well Jamadar," said the military officer, "What does
the Rani say? Did you see her personally"?</p>

<p>"I saw the Princess, your Excellency," returned the
Jamadar. "She bade me say that she waits to learn the
pleasure of your will."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me, Jamadar," continued the officer. "Was there
any sign of uneasiness about the palace? People gathering,
or additions being made to the Rani's bodyguard"?</p>

<p>"My eyes beheld no such gathering of people," returned
the Jamadar laconically. "The Rani's servants
are resting from the heat."</p>

<p>The officer ordered his subordinate to return to the
cantonments. As they moved forward he turned a look
of satisfaction toward his companion.</p>

<p>"Well Hawksley," said he. "I doubt after all if we
shall have the fun yet of cutting our way through a
mass of fanatics."</p>

<p>The Commissioner's face maintained a thoughtful expression.</p>

<p>"I did not anticipate that we would," he returned.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you are as full of gloomy forebodings as
any old fortune teller," asserted the other.</p>

<p>"Oh! not at all," exclaimed the Commissioner, "only
I think the situation more serious than the rest of us are
inclined to regard it."</p>

<p>"What in Jhansi"?</p>

<p>"Yes, in Jhansi. Now look here, Vane," continued the
Commissioner gravely. "Let us see how we stand.
There is no doubt something horrible has taken place in
Delhi."</p>

<p>"Rumors only," interposed the other, "and even then
an isolated case. That old rascal, Bahadur Shah, will
soon be brought to his senses, and punished drop for
drop of our blood."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>"I hope so," remarked the Commissioner. "But this
morning I heard that the troops at Bareli had revolted
and seized the place."</p>

<p>"A band of marauders," added the soldier lightly.
"They will be hanged when caught, every one of them.
For my part, I fail to perceive how these scattered out-breaks
are likely to affect us in Jhansi."</p>

<p>"Yes, indirectly they may," the Commissioner persisted.
"Now look here, Vane. Think a moment seriously,
if you can do such a thing. Here we are a paltry
hundred and fifty odd Europeans in the heart of India,
far removed from the least chance of assistance."</p>

<p>"We shall not need any," remarked the soldier emphatically.
"If the people hereabout should create any
disturbance, my men will soon deal with them. They
have sworn to a unit that they will stand by their salt
oath of allegiance. I have implicit confidence in them."</p>

<p>"Granted! Granted that what you assert may be true,"
rejoined the Commissioner, "but to my mind the element
of danger here lies in another direction."</p>

<p>"Where pray"? demanded the other dubiously.</p>

<p>They had passed the gate and were traversing the almost
deserted bazaars.</p>

<p>"Where pray"? he asked again, glancing along a row
of empty stalls. "I confess, I fail to note any sign of
it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not," rejoined the Commissioner, "but it is
in evidence nevertheless. I refer to the Rani."</p>

<p>"What, to that girl, the Rani," the officer exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense! What mischief can she do. Her talons have
been well pared for any evil that she might design."</p>

<p>"My dear Vane," said the Commissioner sagely.
"Never underestimate the power and resources of a
woman, if she nourishes a grievance."</p>

<p>"A grievance"?</p>

<p>"Yes, frankly, though unofficially, I consider that she
has a grievance&mdash;even a just one against us. Now what
is her position? First, we took from her the estate of her
affianced husband, that by her law she was clearly entitled
to hold."</p>

<p>"But transferred, I thought, according to the provisions
of a treaty made with the late Raja."</p>

<p>"True, but still she was none the less a heavy loser
by it. Well then, by way of recompense for this, what
did we do? We gave her a paltry $30,000 a year."</p>

<p>"A devilish good allowance, I call it," flippantly interposed
Vane. "I only wish I had $30,000 a year, and the
Rani or the deuce might do what they pleased with Jhansi.
Dear old Pall Mall would soon see me on the double."</p>

<p>The Commissioner refused to notice his companion's
light humor.</p>

<p>"Out of that allowance," he proceeded, "small enough
in all conscience for one in her position, we insisted on
deducting a sinking fund to pay the late Raja's debts."</p>

<p>Vane struck his boot a smart rap with the end of his
whip.</p>

<p>"Oh, hang it!" he exclaimed. "That was bad. It's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
shocking enough to be obliged to meet one's own i.o.u.'s;
but to settle up for another fellow is monstrous. My
sympathy there is with the Rani, though it wasn't our
fault, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I thought that would appeal to you," remarked
the Commissioner dryly, "but if I am not mistaken that
matter of killing cows, in spite of her protests, has enraged
her more than the loss of either the Jhansi throne
or the revenue. That, was an unnecessary insult to her
religious sensibilities. Now what I maintain is this, if
she has been waiting for a favorable opportunity to strike
a blow for what she may regard as her lost position and
injured feelings, the present is as good a one as she is
likely to be afforded. Her influence with the people is,
I am convinced, a quantity worth taking into account."</p>

<p>Vane yawned with the heat and the little interest he
felt in both the subject and the visit. He was satisfied
that the Commissioner's fears were groundless, that there
was not the slightest danger of an outbreak in Jhansi, and
only with difficulty had he been persuaded to accompany
his colleague to the Rani's palace.</p>

<p>"In any case, suppose there is something in your idea,"
he asked, "what can she do"?</p>

<p>"That is exactly what we are going to try and discover,"
returned the Commissioner firmly.</p>

<p>They had arrived before the main entrance to the
palace. They dismounted and handed the reins of their
horses to the native orderly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Vane glanced contemptuously at an obsequious aged
servant who had come forth to receive them, and round
upon the drowsy appearance of the buildings.</p>

<p>"Conspiracy! Uprising of the people! Nonsense"!
he ejaculated. "Hawksley's imagination has gone wandering.
I'd wager six months' pay the girl is trembling
at the bare idea of our visit."</p>

<p>As the request for an audience had been made upon
the spur of the moment, the Commissioner regarded it
as a favorable sign that the Rani consented to receive
them without delay.</p>

<p>They were ushered through an inner courtyard surrounded
by cloisters, in the shade of which a few Natives
awoke to salute the Foreign Sahibs as they passed.
Thence through dark halls and ante-chambers, in which
the echo of their footsteps alone broke the profound silence
that had descended on the palace. At last they
crossed the threshold of the <i>Darbar</i> hall.</p>

<p>At the further end of the noble chamber, where for
centuries it had been the custom of the Princes of Jhansi
to dispense justice, she, from whom justice had been
withheld, stood to receive her visitors. In the sight of
the two officers as they gazed down a nave of pillars
supporting the ornately decorated roof, she appeared as
the statue of some divinity in the far perspective of an
ancient temple&mdash;a youthful, white robed, graceful figure,
brought into strong relief by a dark background of gold
embroidered arras.</p>

<p>As if to emphasize the powerless condition to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
she had been reduced, the Rani was attended by a single
waiting woman, who remained throughout the interview
a few paces in her rear, motionless and apparently unobservant.</p>

<p>The officers advanced to within a few paces of her
position and saluted her respectfully.</p>

<p>With a slight inclination of her head, she acknowledged
their greeting and waited to learn the nature of their
errand.</p>

<p>The Commissioner had anticipated that the Rani would
have hastily surrounded herself with numerous retainers
to impress him with a semblance of her power. He realized
that a hundred splendidly attired courtiers could not
have added a shade of prestige to this girl, who stood
alone.</p>

<p>It was not only the majestic pose, nor the beautiful contour
of her face, crowned by a mass of dark hair, ornamented
with a chaplet of pearls, that quickly confirmed
the Commissioner's previous impression that Lachmi Bai,
Rani of Jhansi, was far removed from the generally accepted
type of her countrywomen. But there was a
strength of character emphasized in every line of her
distinctly Aryan features, a force of will, a mystical
power in every flash of her lustrous eyes, in every movement,
in every word, however gently spoken, warning
him at the outset that he had to deal with no shrinking,
simple, <i>zanana</i> maiden.</p>

<p>He had come prepared to assume a firm, if necessary a
dictatorial attitude; but now in her presence he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
himself slowly paving the way by conventional compliments.</p>

<p>Her silence at last compelled him to come to the point.</p>

<p>"Your Highness," he began, "will doubtless have
heard of the disturbances that have broken out in several
districts of the Northwest Provinces."</p>

<p>"Some reports have reached my ears," she replied,
with apparent indifference, "but I give to them little
credence."</p>

<p>"I am afraid," resumed the Commissioner gravely,
"that there is only too much reason to believe their authenticity.
I have, therefore, sought this audience with
your Highness to request that in the event of any threatened
outbreak in Jhansi, you will use your influence to
preserve peace. I need not add that by so doing, by
demonstrating at such a crisis that your sympathy is with
the British Government, you will be rendering a service
to the latter that I, personally, will guarantee shall not
be overlooked."</p>

<p>The representative of the power that had deprived her
of her possessions stood before her as a supplicant for
her good will.</p>

<p>A nature less subtle, less under such admirable control,
might at the moment have been over tempted to cast
prudence to the winds, and in an outburst of long gathering
passion jeopardize the complete success of her plans
by summoning her retainers to seize prematurely the
persons of the British officers. But trained in adversity,
that best of schools to curb her real feelings, by not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
sign did she betray, that for months past she had been
preparing for the hour when the fate of Jhansi should rest
in the palm of her hand; nor the infallible knowledge she
possessed, that every man in the city, aye even every
woman and child, together with the whole body of native
troops within the British cantonments, awaited her signal
to rise in revolt.</p>

<p>In a voice, in which only the faintest note of irony
was mingled with surprise, she answered quietly.</p>

<p>"Surely the Foreign Sahib sets too great store upon
my ability to assist him. What have I," she continued,
raising the tone slightly, and extending a hand so that
the gold bangles on her wrist jingled musically. "What
influence hath Lachmi Bai with the people to control
their actions? If they should rebel, has not the Sahib
soldiers and guns to enforce his will; I, but a few poor
servants to protect my person. No," she concluded, letting
her hand fall again to her side, "the Sahib knows
well I have no power, no authority in Jhansi."</p>

<p>The Commissioner twirled his moustache musingly.
He knew that without doubt she had stated the literal
truth; but he was now more firmly convinced than ever,
that behind the dark eyes which so unflinchingly returned
his gaze, there lay a power for good or evil in a possible
emergency, that it would be suicidal to ignore.</p>

<p>Gravely he resumed the subject.</p>

<p>"It would be a poor compliment," he said, "to the
esteem in which it is well known your Highness is held
by the people, to place your influence at so low a value.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
Should an uprising take place in Jhansi, you could do
much to preserve law and order."</p>

<p>For a few moments neither spoke. Each regarded the
other as if endeavoring to find a vulnerable point in the
contest of diplomacy, when the Rani skilfully turned the
subject to her own advantage. She was anxious to discover
if any suspicion of her plans had been engendered
in the minds of the Foreigners, and how far they depended
for their safety upon the fidelity of their native
troops, already won over to her cause. She therefore
replied by another question.</p>

<p>"But have you any reason to think that the peace will
be broken in Jhansi"?</p>

<p>"At present, I have not," the Commissioner replied,
after a short period of reflection.</p>

<p>"And even in that event you can surely rely upon the
loyalty of your native troops"? she suggested with apparent
absence of motive.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe so," he affirmed decisively. "Certainly
they will remain true to their salt."</p>

<p>"Then why come to me," she asked, "to seek assistance
for which you are likely to have so little need"?</p>

<p>The Commissioner realized that argumentatively, his
position was no longer tenable. So he determined to
revert to his original purpose and make a firm demand
upon the evasive young Princess.</p>

<p>"Nevertheless," he replied sternly. "It is my duty to
inform you, that the British Government will hold you
responsible for any outbreak among the people."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The Rani raised her eyebrows slightly, as she retorted
in a rising tone of protest.</p>

<p>"Surely the Commissioner Sahib does not remember
the position in which his Government has placed me. He
forgets that it not only deprived me of my inheritance
of the throne of Jhansi, but of my affianced husband's personal
estates, and even compelled me out of the pittance
of an allowance provided for my support to pay his debts.
Thus, often have the poor in vain cried to me to alleviate
their distress, daily are Brahmans turned from my gates
unfed. I cannot help them. For the reason that you
have deprived me of the means wherewith even to influence
the actions of a beggar, I cannot assist you. I do
not see, nay, I do not understand how I can be held responsible
for the public peace. As well might you extract
the teeth of a watch dog and expect it to guard your
treasure safely. Does your Government also hold me
responsible for the loyalty of your troops"? she concluded,
with a note of scorn.</p>

<p>"No," he returned with emphasis, "but it will undoubtedly
look to your Highness to act in the event of
an outbreak, as I have suggested."</p>

<p>The ultimatum had been delivered.</p>

<p>The two officers bowed to the Rani and retraced their
steps to the end of the hall. On the threshold Vane
paused for a moment. He glanced over his shoulder and
met the gaze of the Rani still fixed upon them. With
her hands folded she had remained in the same position;
but there was an unmistakable expression of scornful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
triumph on her face, carrying swift conviction to his
mind, that their mission had failed, that this mere girl
had routed their arguments and baffled their diplomacy.</p>

<p>As they passed down the steps, he linked his arm in
that of his companion. He spoke in an undertone, with
no vestige of his flippant humor remaining.</p>

<p>"I say, Hawksley. I say, old fellow. D'you know, I
think the Rani is a devilish clever girl. We didn't get
much out of her, did we"?</p>

<p>The Commissioner eyed his companion seriously.</p>

<p>"Yes," he acquiesced. "For my part, Vane, I believe
it would have been better for all of us if we had arrived
at that conclusion before."</p>

<p>They had scarcely disappeared from the hall, when
white figures seemed to emerge from the very walls.</p>

<p>The Rani waved them back with a warning gesture.</p>

<p>"Go," she enjoined her attendant. "Go, Rati, and
see if the Foreigners have left the court."</p>

<p>In a few minutes the girl returned with the information
that the Foreign Sahibs had mounted their horses.</p>

<p>The Rani raised her arms above her head and cried
aloud as she gave full vent to her suppressed emotion.</p>

<p>"Fools! Fools all! Of what do they think I am
made. Am I clay to be moulded into any form, a pitcher
with which to draw water for them when thirsty? Ah!
By the great God of Gods, I swear that before another
sun has set, they shall find that the will, if not the form
of Lachmi Bai is fashioned out of steel."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>Quickly she was surrounded by an eager throng,
clamoring for news of the audience.</p>

<p>"What said the Foreign Sahibs, O Rani"? they besought
her. "Tell us, O Queen, what said they"?</p>

<p>She waved them from her gently.</p>

<p>"It is enough," she cried, "that still hearing no sound
but the call to plunder, they are deaf to the mighty
whisper passed down from palace to hovel, and on from
city to jungle, that the hour for India is at hand."</p>

<h2>Chapter II<br />

<i>THE HOUR AT HAND</i></h2>


<p>In a shaded room of the palace, the Rani had cast herself
upon a low divan to obtain a short period of
rest. The rugs of intricate patterns, embroidered
hangings, curiously carved and inlaid screens,
tables, and taborets, gave to the apartment an atmosphere
more of richness, than comfort from the Occidental point
of view. She watched reflectively the actions of her waiting
woman in placing a smoking paraphernalia at her side.</p>

<p>"Strange, how strange," she murmured, "are the ways
of these Foreigners. After all the wrongs they have
visited upon me, the insults I have suffered at their
hands; they boldly come and demand my influence to
maintain such iniquities. They expect, forsooth, that if
the door of my prison is opened, I will close it again upon
myself. Surely they must think I possess less reason
than a creature bereft of its senses. I&mdash;I cannot understand
them."</p>

<p>She turned her head to notice a stout, little man,
<i>salaaming</i> profoundly.</p>

<p>"Well, good Bipin," she exclaimed. "What matter of
supreme weight and urgency is it now? Hath an evil
minded fox crossed thy path on thy way to the temple, or
a crow dropped a tail feather with sinister intent upon
thy turban"?</p>

<p>"Protector of thy People," replied Bipin, "your Extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Greatness will be pleased to know, that the
illustrious Raja, Sivapuri Prasad Singh, an emissary
from the Peshwa, awaits your Highness's command to
enter."</p>

<p>The Rani rose to her feet instantly, manifesting intense
emotion in her voice and actions, as she cried:</p>

<p>"The Peshwa's messenger at last. Go, good Bipin,
bring him to me immediately. There is no one I long
to see more than this same emissary from the Peshwa."</p>

<p>She had scarcely spoken when Bipin ushered into the
room a Hindu noble of gallant mien, whose attire bore
traces of hasty travel through jungle by-paths. He strode
hurriedly forward and bowing before the Rani, glanced
round with suspicion.</p>

<p>The Rani waved her male servitor from the room.</p>

<p>"Speak, noble sir," she urged reassuringly. "The
walls are deaf as well as dumb. Ah, <i>Mahadeva!</i> How
anxiously we have awaited thy coming."</p>

<p>"Good news, My Lady Rani," he replied, in an undertone.
"The torch has been ignited. To-morrow
Dundhu Panth proclaims himself Peshwa, and Cawnpore
will fall into his hands. Strike now, for if Jhansi is won,
other states, that waver, will follow suit. Such is the
Peshwa's command."</p>

<p>"Welcome, most welcome, noble Raja," she cried, in
a transport of joyful emotion. She extended her hands
in greeting. "Welcome to the palace of the no longer
unfortunate Rani of Jhansi."</p>

<p>He took the jeweled fingers of one of her hands in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
his and bowing low placed them to his forehead. Then
he drew himself up and gazed with sudden admiration at
the superb form, the beautiful features of the high caste
Princess.</p>

<p>In a moment he resumed the conversation, still in a
tone of caution.</p>

<p>"Are all thy plans complete, fair Lady"?</p>

<p>"Aye, even over complete, I had feared," she answered.
"The hidden guns in the fortress have been disinterred,
my retainers armed, guards posted on the highways to
prevent the escape of the Foreigners, when the signal is
given. All people in Jhansi wait impatiently upon my
word."</p>

<p>"It is well," he exclaimed, approvingly. "But how
about the Mohammedans? Can they be depended
upon"?</p>

<p>"Ahmad Khan moves them at the raising of his hand."</p>

<p>"Aye, but of Ahmad Khan. At the raising of whose
hand doth he obey without question"?</p>

<p>The Rani slowly raised her hand and held it outstretched
before her.</p>

<p>A dart of racial jealousy pierced the Hindu noble's
breast.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed. "It is perhaps well thus, for
the moment."</p>

<p>The Rani's arm fell lightly to her side.</p>

<p>"It is well for all time, so long as we are united," she
returned, with significant emphasis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Prasad moved a step nearer and spoke almost in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"What of the Foreigners? Do they suspect a rising"?</p>

<p>"They are in doubt, but rely implicitly upon the fidelity
of their Native troops."</p>

<p>"Will their Native troops join us"?</p>

<p>"Every man among them."</p>

<p>"Are you certain"?</p>

<p>"As certain as that the wolf will hunt with his kind."</p>

<p>Prasad paused thoughtfully before putting another
question.</p>

<p>"If we succeed what is to be done with the Foreigners"?</p>

<p>"Ahmad has my order to secure them as prisoners.
We will hold them as hostages or send them out of the
state."</p>

<p>Prasad took the Rani's hand in his and pressed it
gently. Already he was a slave to her will. Henceforth
the form of Lachmi Bai filled his soul with one
aim above all others.</p>

<p>"Ah, my Lord," she cried, turning a radiant countenance
toward him. "How long hath my heart pined for
this hour&mdash;the hour when the scepter which was snatched
from my grasp shall be placed in my hand; and the law
of the Foreigner be no longer obeyed in Jhansi."</p>

<p>"Surely it is thy right, noble Rani," he replied. "When
then can the signal be given"?</p>

<p>"Now, to-night, to-morrow, at any time."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then make certain that all is ready to-night, and
let the signal be given for to-morrow."</p>

<p>The Rani beckoned her waiting woman to her side.</p>

<p>"Go," said she. "Go swiftly, let it be known that
to-morrow at noon, the tigress will break down the bars
of her cage."</p>

<h2>Chapter III<br />

<i>BY THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE</i></h2>


<p>Jhansi had fallen. At the revolt of their troops
the Foreigners were taken completely by surprise.
They hastily retreated to the Star Fort where,
after a valorous defense for three days, lack of
food and ammunition compelled them to surrender. They
were obliged to seek terms of Ahmad Khan who was conducting
the siege.</p>

<p>If they evacuated the fort would they be permitted to
leave the state unmolested? was the request made under
a flag of truce.</p>

<p>In response, Ahmad solemnly swore upon the holy
Koran that if the Foreigners would open the gates no
harm should befall them.</p>

<p>But the oath of the Mohammedan was not regarded
as sufficiently binding. The Foreigners required a further
assurance of safety from the Rani.</p>

<p>In her name Ahmad reiterated his vow of protection.
This was all the hope of security they could possibly look
for in their desperate situation. The Rani had ever been
regarded as an upright woman. Upon the faith of her
word they opened the gates and laid down their arms.
Then under Ahmad's direction they marched out to a field
nearby,&mdash;a pitiful, defenseless band, of men, women, and
children.</p>

<p>The sun never shone upon a more brutal tragedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Beside a clump of trees all were ruthlessly butchered.
Their honor alone was spared. Without a plea for
mercy, without a cry of anguish, these heroes met a cruel
fate, that might have been averted by a less exacting
government.</p>

<p>Ahmad Khan was elated almost to a condition of intoxication
by this final successful act of the revolt. He was
now prompted to strike another immediate blow to gratify
a long secretly nourished ambition. While outwardly he
had professed intense devotion to the Rani's cause, in his
heart, he aspired to seat himself on the throne of the
Rajas of Jhansi. As to the Rani, he purposed that her
rule should be encompassed by the walls of a luxurious
<i>harem</i>.</p>

<p>At the head of a crime-frenzied Mohammedan band,
bearing upon the points of their bayonets ghastly trophies
of the recent massacre, he set forth on a triumphant
progress to the palace.</p>

<p>To secure his object, he instructed his followers to
overawe the Hindu population, devoted to the Rani's
cause, by fierce gestures and loud shouts in his honor.</p>

<p>He entered the gate set in the massive stone wall, and
waved his sword aloft crying&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Faith. The holy Faith. Success to the Faith
of Mohammed."</p>

<p>His soldiers pressed closely upon the flanks of his
horse. They brandished their weapons and struck dismay
into the hearts of the Hindu guard, by adding exultingly
to their distinctive shout of victory&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"And may Ahmad Khan, the Servant of God, long
reign in Jhansi."</p>

<p>Onward the mob swept through the city, again and
again vociferously proclaiming Ahmad Khan, Raja of
Jhansi. The joy of the Hindus over their deliverance from
Foreign rule gave place to alarm. They watched with
misgiving a second <i>coup d' etat</i> on the part of their hereditary
enemies, and began to wonder whether they would
not fare worse under the rule of a follower of Mohammed,
than they had done under that of the Foreigner.</p>

<p>In her palace the Rani anxiously awaited news of the
surrender. Through Ahmad she had given the assurance
that the Foreigners' lives would be spared. This
course she had strenuously urged upon her lieutenant.
Apart from her womanly repugnance to ruthless slaughter,
she clearly perceived the advantage she would gain
by holding them as prisoners to exchange for the recognition
of her right to the throne of Jhansi. To kill the
innocent, the already defeated, did not occupy a thought
in her mind.</p>

<p>The news came swift and ominous. Not only had a
tragedy taken place, but her own authority was in danger
of usurpation.</p>

<p>The exultant Mohammedan cry rolled forward to the
walls of the palace. It penetrated to the Rani's ears at
first as a welcome sound; but as it rose in the courtyard
bearing aloft the name of Ahmad Khan, a disquieting
thought flashed into her brain.</p>

<p>She hurried to the <i>Darbar</i> hall, entering at one end, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Ahmad, surrounded by his officers, crossed the threshold
at the other.</p>

<p>The Rani halted and waited. Intuitively she gleaned
confirmation of her sudden alarm from their faces.</p>

<p>Ahmad advanced and saluted her with pointed courtesy.
He was a tall, powerfully built man, whose swarthy irregular
features indicated a mingling of low caste blood.
As a whole his face was not unhandsome, though the
expression of his mouth and chin denoted cruelty and
treachery&mdash;the latter, perhaps, an accomplishment rather
than a failing to the Oriental mind.</p>

<p>"Greeting, fair Lady," he exclaimed. "Jhansi is won.
The Foreigners have surrendered."</p>

<p>She directed a searching glance to read the veiled meaning
expressed in his intonation as well as in his
manner.</p>

<p>"They have surrendered. Then where are they"? she
asked. "Hast thou not brought any of them hither"?</p>

<p>A cruel smile broke upon Ahmad's face as he turned
and pointed with the blade of his sword to the open doorway,
through which could be caught a glimpse of the
surging mob without, uplifting their bloody trophies.</p>

<p>"Aye," he explained, "I have brought some of them
here. The rest I have sent to a secure prison."</p>

<p>His gesture was observed by his followers. The shout
rose with greater volume than before&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Deen! Deen! Futteh. Mohammed.</i>"</p>

<p>"Success to the Faith of Mohammed."</p>

<p>For a moment the Rani covered her eyes with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
hands, as if to blot out the gruesome spectacle. Then she
demanded sternly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why hast thou done this, my Lord? Surely thou
hast not killed them all"?</p>

<p>"Aye, all, fair Lady. And why not"? he returned, in
plausible accents.</p>

<p>"Because I commanded you to spare their lives if they
surrendered," she retorted, passionately.</p>

<p>Ahmad bowed low with feigned contrition.</p>

<p>"But, my Lady Lachmi Bai," he protested, "a
higher authority, the Emperor of Delhi, had commanded
me to spare none of them. Further his Majesty hath
been pleased to place the government of the State of
Jhansi in my hands until more settled times."</p>

<p>The two stood for a short period confronting each other
in silence, Ahmad with a look of unconcealed triumph
on his face, on that of the Rani, anger mingled with
defiance.</p>

<p>"So this was his purpose! A plot within a plot revealed."</p>

<p>He strode up to her and with assurance took her by the
hand. Then he spoke in a lower voice.</p>

<p>"Ah! Fair Rani. Thou art but a child, a girl fit
rather to play with gems than swords and scepters. But
fear not, thou shalt rule in Jhansi. Thou knowest well for
what I hunger. All that thou longest for, thou shalt possess
in return. It is a good bargain, is it not, Beautiful
One"?</p>

<p>Her glance swept from his face to the crowd of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
officers standing to his order in the background. She
realized that the dominion for which she had so long
and patiently striven was about to be seized by another at
the moment of its accomplishment. By one, too whose
religious principles were repugnant, and whose profession
of personal devotion she had but tolerated for reasons
of state. She saw the trap into which she had
fallen, and from which an immediate counterstroke of
diplomacy could alone save her.</p>

<p>Her mind was quick to grasp the situation and suggest
a remedy.</p>

<p>With an effort she curbed her resentment and turned
a look of approval upon the traitor.</p>

<p>"Aye, thou speakest truly," she replied, in a thoughtful
tone. "I am, as thou sayest, but a girl, to whom the
reins of government would be of little pleasure. I had
longed that the Foreigners be driven forth from Jhansi.
Now they are here no more to anger me, why should I
not be satisfied? But, O Ahmad," she continued confidentially,
"I would speak with thee alone. Send, I pray
thee, these people of thine from the palace. I like not
their fierce looks and clash of arms."</p>

<p>Ahmad was surprised. He had anticipated a stormy
scene with the Rani, and a possible resort to force before
she could be brought to submit to his will. Consequently
he was gratified to meet with so little resistance to both
his political and personal designs. For the moment he
failed to remember that the brain which had displayed
such masterly craft in plotting the downfall of the Foreigners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
would be swift to use the same power in frustrating
his own project.</p>

<p>In compliance with her desire he faced his officers.</p>

<p>"Go," he commanded. "Return to the cantonments
and in my name seize all the possessions of the Foreigners."</p>

<p>When the soldiers had left the hall the Rani drew close
to him and spoke in a beguiling voice.</p>

<p>"O my Lord, thou must see how poorly I am attired
in honor of so great an event. I would retire for a short
space, to adorn my neck with jewels, and my hair with
flowers; so that I may appear worthy of the noble Ahmad
Khan's approval."</p>

<p>Blinded by vanity, he was flattered and deceived by her
cajolery. He stretched forth his arms to enfold her in
an embrace.</p>

<p>"Thou shadow of an <i>houri</i>," he exclaimed
amorously.</p>

<p>She eluded him by a quick movement.</p>

<p>"In a little," she returned, playfully. "See that thou
waitest until I come again to thee. Then shalt thou
swear by thy Prophet's beard, that Lachmi Bai hath wit
as well as beauty."</p>

<p>"Until death," he replied, "only tarry not too long,
Fair One."</p>

<p>She cast toward him an enthralling glance, and passing
from the hall, hurried to the inner apartments of the
palace.</p>

<p>"Now by Allah"! he reflected, exultingly. "The fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of Ahmad Khan, the Humble Servant of God, doth
rise as the sun in a cloudless heaven."</p>

<p>The Rani's action was swift and silent. She summoned
those upon whom she could rely and spoke in urgent
accents.</p>

<p>"Go quickly," she commanded to one, "into the bazaars
and summon all my people to the courtyard of the palace."
To another, "Let my retainers arm themselves
and guard every outlet so that no man passes in or forth.
Tell Prasad and my officers, that I need their presence on
the balcony overlooking the main entrance. Go, with
wings on your feet. Hasten, for there is no time to be
lost."</p>

<p>She passed into a private chamber and hastily arrayed
herself in a magnificent embroidered <i>sari</i>, the silken clinging
texture of which displayed her form to its perfection
of royal beauty. Round her neck she hung ropes of
pearls, and in her hair she entwined a wreath of fragrant
blossoms. Thus attired she proceeded to the wide balcony
overlooking the courtyard.</p>

<p>A throng of people had gathered and crowded about
the main entrance. Others were hurrying from the
bazaars and side streets at the bidding of the Rani's messengers.
With animated countenances, they asked of
each other the meaning of the summons.</p>

<p>Behind the domes and turrets of the rock citadel, the
sun was sinking toward the horizon. It cast broad shadows
over the courtyard, now filling rapidly with a surging,
excited, human mass. The Rani was quickly joined by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Prasad and officers faithful to her service. With these in
attendance she moved to the edge of the parapet.</p>

<p>Immediately an outburst of enthusiasm rose from the
people, gathering in force until a great shout filled the
air about the palace.</p>

<p>"Lachmi Bai. Lachmi Bai. Rani of Jhansi," they
cried.</p>

<p>She leaned over the parapet and smiled.</p>

<p>Again the cry rose, "Lachmi Bai. Lachmi Bai. Rani
of Jhansi."</p>

<p>She raised her hand to enjoin silence. Gradually the
tumult ceased.</p>

<p>Then she spoke to them. Her resonant, clear, voice
filled the open space. Each word fell musically upon
the ears of her audience.</p>

<p>"My people," she began. "At last you have been
freed from the rule of the Foreigner. To-day, a great
blow has been delivered by you for our independence&mdash;a
blow that will resound in the most distant
provinces of our land. Through your loyalty and courage,
the end for which we have so long striven has been
attained. To you belongs the spoil, the treasure that has
fallen into our hands. It is your reward."</p>

<p>A murmur of applause told that the point had been
well received.</p>

<p>"But my people," she proceeded. "You are still encompassed
by great peril. The Foreigner is destroyed,
but others of his race may return to try and wrest from
you, your country. Enemies, too, may rise from within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
as rapacious and as hateful of your religion. It is necessary
that you choose without delay a fearless and capable
ruler."</p>

<p>A few voices called on her by name, but she again
silenced them.</p>

<p>"As you well know," she continued, "by our law,
to me belongs the right of succession to the throne of
Jhansi."</p>

<p>"Aye, truly," many cried. "Lachmi Bai. Lachmi
Bai. Rani of Jhansi."</p>

<p>"But, my good people, as the noble Raja, Ahmad
Khan, hath pointed out, I am but a girl, uninstructed in
the wiles of statecraft, unused to the wielding of a sword
in dangerous times. A Raja, he declares, must be seated
on the throne of Jhansi. Why not then the illustrious
Ahmad Khan"?</p>

<p>Spontaneously the cry rose, "For us no stranger, no
Mohammedan! We want him not to rule over us.
Lachmi Bai. Lachmi Bai. Rani of Jhansi."</p>

<p>"But, good people," she persisted, as if earnestly pleading
Ahmad's cause. "Ahmad Khan is a brave soldier.
He is"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Her voice was drowned in an uproar that shook the
walls of the palace. Her name alone was borne upward
by thousands of unyielding throats.</p>

<p>"Lachmi Bai. Rani of Jhansi. Lachmi Bai. Rani of
Jhansi."</p>

<p>She stretched out her arms lovingly toward them. She
appealed to them with a captivating smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you then have Lachmi Bai for your ruler in
Jhansi"?</p>

<p>A great shout rose and confirmed her in her right to
the title. The throngs surged back and forth in the
endeavor of those furthest away to reach a spot nearer
to her person.</p>

<p>"Come to us," they cried. "Come down amid thy
people, O Rani."</p>

<p>With a radiant countenance, she passed down the flight
of stone steps into the courtyard. Unguarded she moved
among the mass of people, stirred to a frenzy of enthusiasm
by her presence. Some knelt in her path to touch
the hem of her garment, while others waved their weapons
aloft, vowing they would defend her to the death.</p>

<p>Darkness fell with the swiftness of the Tropics. She
turned to re-enter the palace, and torches flared to light her
path. They gave to the scene a weird, majestic splendor&mdash;the
irregular outlines of the palace overshadowed by
the huge black mass of the fortress; the exultant, white
robed throng; the stern faces of the soldiers; the girl,
whose mysterious being swayed their emotions like the
wind playing upon lotus reeds.</p>

<p>In the <i>Darbar</i> hall Ahmad Khan impatiently awaited
the Rani's return. He was startled by the cries of the
populace, and dismayed at the discovery that his egress
was blocked. Uneasily he paced back and forth, wondering
what these ominous signs betokened. He cursed
his imprudence at having dismissed his followers at so
critical a moment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tricked, I doubt not," he savagely exclaimed. "But
one more fool who loses a crown in exchange for a
woman's smile."</p>

<p>The Rani and her officers swept into the hall. Ahmad's
hand impulsively grasped the hilt of his sword&mdash;a gesture
which Prasad imitated by half withdrawing his from
its scabbard.</p>

<p>The Hindu noble advanced a few paces, regarding
Ahmad's sullen countenance as if willing to accept a challenge.</p>

<p>"Peace, my Lords," the Rani cried authoritatively.</p>

<p>She laid a restraining hand on Prasad's arm.</p>

<p>"Peace. It is my will. This is no hour to broach a
feud."</p>

<p>She then fearlessly advanced to Ahmad's side, and addressed
him calmly.</p>

<p>"My Lord Raja," said she. "My people will have it
that I rule over Jhansi."</p>

<p>She held up her hand to draw his attention to the
acclamations which penetrated the innermost recesses of
the palace.</p>

<p>"You hear them," she continued. "I espoused your
cause to the best of my ability; but, it seems, they will
have no other than Lachmi Bai to be their Rani."</p>

<p>"And now," she concluded, addressing all present, "I
look to you, Ahmad, Prasad, and all my brave officers to
unite for one object, the defense of my throne and
Jhansi."</p>

<p>Ahmad glanced round upon the determined faces of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Rani's loyal supporters, as they vowed to maintain the
crown upon her head. He realized that, in turn, he had
been outwitted. By a low obeisance he outwardly acknowledged
her authority.</p>

<p>"The people are God's," he murmured, "the country is
the <i>Padshah's</i>, and the <i>Raj</i> is the Rani's."</p>

<p>Thus was Lachmi Bai proclaimed Rani of Jhansi.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter IV<br />

<i>A STAR IN THE ASCENDENT</i></h2>


<p>The Rani's ambition to ascend the throne of
Jhansi was achieved. But immediately she
beheld difficulties rise on all sides. Everyone
in Jhansi seemed to have a claim to urge upon
her gratitude. The larger the pecuniary recompense that
was supposed to be attached to a place of honor, the
more numerous were the applicants. To that of the
greatest responsibility, the command of the troops, the
Rani was in a dilemma as to whom she would appoint.</p>

<p>From his well known military skill and tried valor,
Ahmad Khan might wisely have been selected for the
office; but the Rani hesitated to confide to his hands so
much power after his recent exhibition of disloyalty.</p>

<p>In the meantime Ahmad had sullenly retired to his
house without the city, there to plead sickness as an excuse
for failing to respond to her summons to court.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Prasad remained close to her side,
hourly transforming the early esteem which the Rani
had conceived for him, into a warmer sentiment. He,
too, intimated that his aspiration lay toward the chief
military prize in the Rani's gift; but thus far she had
let it pass ungratified, if not unrecognized. Apart from
his untried ability as a commander, she realized that to
appoint Prasad, a newcomer to the state, to such a coveted
position, would surely stir up a feeling of bitter jealousy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
in the breasts of a score of Jhansi officers, who might
justly claim a prior right to her consideration. These
matters increasingly harassed the Rani's mind.</p>

<p>The morning of a few days after her accession discovered
the Rani in the act of formally announcing that
event, by letter, to the other princes who had risen in
rebellion against the rule of the Foreigners.</p>

<p>Before her, Bipin Dat sat cross-legged upon a mat. He
was laboriously endeavoring to indite these missives in
what he considered to be correct form.</p>

<p>After a period of effort, he drew the Rani's attention
to his latest production.</p>

<p>"This letter, noble Rani," said he, "is to the most illustrious
Dhundu Panth, Peshwa of the Marathas."</p>

<p>The Rani signified her willingness to listen, and Bipin
proceeded to read in a sonorous voice, emphasizing the
repetition of his own name by inflection of tone, and gestures&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<div class="center"><i>By the hand of the Intellectual<br />
Bipin Dat<br />
Secretary to Her Highness, Lachmi Bai,<br />
Rani of Ihansiv
To<br />
The most noble, Dhundu Panth,<br />
Peshwa of the Marathas<br />
Greeting<br />
</i>
</div>

<p>"Be it known to you, O most Illustrious Sir, that
by the will of God and the pleasure of the great Rani,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the Honorable Bipin Dat ventures to address your Sublimity,
for the purpose of disclosing certain information,
as follows:</p>

<p>"On the 8th of the month the Foreigners were obliterated
from the face of the earth in Jhansi, as if the devil
had swept them all off into Hades. Further, on the same
day, it pleased the great God to direct His people to seat
Her Immortal Highness, Lachmi Bai, upon the throne of
the Rajas of Jhansi, which events were witnessed by the
observant eye, and recorded by the unerring hand of her
faithful and esteemed servant, Bipin Dat.</p>

<p>"Lastly, it hath pleased Her Highness the Rani, to
recognize the services of the aforesaid Bipin Dat in these
great times, by appointing him her <i>munshi</i>.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Whereby he
has set his hand to this letter on the 12th day of the
month, etc.</p>

<div class="right">
(Signed) "BIPIN DAT,<br />
"Secretary to the Rani of Jhansi."<br />
</div>

</blockquote>

<p>Bipin finished his reading with a flourish of the hand
and a look upon his solemnly cherubic countenance,
that indicated his perfect satisfaction with the composition.</p>

<p>"That, noble Rani," said he, "will in proper form
convey to the Peshwa the news of your Highness's accession."</p>

<p>A smile momentarily relieved the Rani's serious expression.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<p>"He will also," she remarked, "be in little doubt as
to the identity of the writer. The Peshwa, the Rani,
and the Intellectual Bipin Dat. He may wonder if the
third is not the most important of the three."</p>

<p>Bipin stroked his chin musingly.</p>

<p>"Dust under thy feet," he replied at last. "That could
scarcely be the case, but it has ever been the opinion of
the most learned <i>pundits</i> that in the work of great writers
their personality shines forth as a diamond amid false
gems."</p>

<p>"Then Bipin, thou must be a veritable stone of the first
water," she replied. "But one thing I gather. You, at
any rate, out of a multitude of aspirants for office, appear
satisfied with your position."</p>

<p>"Noble Rani," he continued. "Satisfied am I of thy
graciousness; but of the precise moment when it will be
advisable for me formally to take upon myself the burden
of my duties, I am not yet determined."</p>

<p>A look of displeasure crossed the Rani's face.</p>

<p>"How mean you"? she asked. "Have you, too, some
petition to make that I will exchange it for one that brings
a better revenue"?</p>

<p>"Noble Lady," he replied, "mere wealth holds out
little inducement for those of intellectual worth. We,
who are writers with inspired thoughts, look for a more
imperishable reward; but in all events of importance it is
ever well to consult those who read the future and who
can discern the most auspicious moment to take an important
step."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh!" exclaimed the Rani. "Thou wouldst consult
thy friend, the astrologer"?</p>

<p>Bipin bowed.</p>

<p>"Such is my desire, noble Lady."</p>

<p>"Go, then," she cried, "and get thy consultation over
quickly, for I need the service of thy pen."</p>

<p>Bipin rose from his sitting posture. He <i>salaamed</i>
thrice before his mistress and departed with an important
air.</p>

<p>In the shadow of the pillar by the main entrance the
blind beggar, who appeared to have sat there from the
beginning of all time, instinctively recognized Bipin's
footsteps. He accosted the secretary with a petition for
alms.</p>

<p>"Good clerk," he cried. "Have pity upon the unfortunate."</p>

<p>Bipin halted and faced him with a look of offended
dignity.</p>

<p>"Good clerk!" he returned, in scornful accents. "Good
clerk! Thou fool. Dost know to whom thou art speaking"?</p>

<p>"Surely to the worthy clerk, Bipin Dat," replied the
beggar, innocently. "Many a time hath he cast a crumb
to the afflicted."</p>

<p>Bipin scowled magnificently upon the beggar.</p>

<p>"Then seldom in future will the afflicted benefit by his
compassion," he returned sternly, "unless they have more
discernment than to style him a clerk. Know, thou fool,
that he to whom thou criest is no longer a clerk, but hath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
so gained the ear of the noble Rani, that she hath appointed
him to be her secretary."</p>

<p>His breast swelled with pride as he authoritatively announced
his new rank.</p>

<p>"Secretary to the Rani," cried the beggar in astonishment.
"Secretary to the Rani. Behold how God rewardeth
the deserving. Protector of the Humble," he
whined, "it was my infirmity that led me to make the
mistake."</p>

<p>"Be careful then not to make such a mistake again,"
replied Bipin, mollified by the beggar's submissive tone.</p>

<p>He tossed a <i>pice</i> into the beggar's outstretched palm.
Then, with lordly gait, he strutted on his way through the
bazaars.</p>

<p>That Bipin Dat had become a man of authority was
quickly impressed upon the friends and acquaintances he
encountered. With condescending dignity he returned
their effusive salutations, clearly intimating that a wide
gulf of distinction lay between Bipin Dat the Rani's present
secretary, and Bipin Dat the former ordinary clerk.
Upon the children that sedately played in his path he
frowned so threateningly that they shrunk back at his
approach. He carried his head as if his turban already
swept the clouds. In his mind the question uppermost
was, to what height might his ascending star of fortune
still further exalt the name of Bipin Dat.</p>

<p>At length he turned from the broad, booth-lined thoroughfare
into a narrow alley, and directed his steps
toward the door of a squalid house. He halted and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
knocked several times before he received an answer to
his summons. The door was cautiously opened, and a
woman appeared.</p>

<p>"Is thy learned husband, Mohurran Goshi, within"?
he demanded.</p>

<p>"My honored husband is at present deeply engaged in
compiling the horoscope of a noble raja," replied the
woman, "but if you will enter, I will bear him a message."</p>

<p>"Aye, do thou tell him that the Honorable Bipin Dat,
Secretary to the Rani, would engage his ear for a space.
Thy husband hath already done me service."</p>

<p>At the woman's invitation he crossed the threshold of
a bare and dingy room, the air of which was filled with
a savory odor, rising from a pot placed upon a small fire.
To this, Bipin directed his attention, that ever in close
sympathy with his stomach, was alert to be interested in
the progress of cooking.</p>

<p>The woman disappeared from view through an inner
door.</p>

<p>After an absence of several minutes she returned with
a reply. Her husband, though deep in study, would nevertheless
receive so good a client as the Rani's secretary.
Would he be pleased to pass into the other room?</p>

<p>Bipin followed the woman's direction and found himself
in an apartment divided in the center by a curtain.
There, seated upon the floor, the grave astrologer Mohurran
Goshi, was surrounded by books and a variety of scientific
instruments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>For some moments after Bipin's entrance the astrologer
appeared too profoundly absorbed in his work to notice
the presence of his visitor. At last he withdrew his gaze
from an abtruse calculation, and directed a keen glance
toward the face of the Rani's secretary.</p>

<p>"Welcome, worthy Secretary," he exclaimed. "Thou
seest I prophesied truly. Yesterday a clerk, to-day a secretary;
who knows, to-morrow thou mayest attain thy
ambition and become a zemindar."</p>

<p>"A zemindar, forsooth!" cried Bipin, disdainfully.
"Thou must know, learned Astrologer, that my ambition
now rises beyond the station of a zemindar. A
raja! Why not a raja"? he exclaimed, strutting back
and forth. "Why should I not aspire to become a
raja"?</p>

<p>"There is truly no reason, good Secretary," replied the
astrologer, "why you should not become a raja, if the
fates are propitious. Is not the great Maharaja Sindhia
descended from a slipper-bearer"?</p>

<p>"To be sure," acquiesced Bipin, confidently. "I see
no reason why I should not become a raja, and for that
matter even a maharaja."</p>

<p>"Thou mayest even become a king," suggested the astrologer,
with a note of sarcasm in his voice.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, who can tell, a king," agreed Bipin, reflectively.
"But not too great a jump at first, learned sir.
One might become a trifle dizzy. At present I will beg
of thee to cast thy eye into the future and see if I am in
the right way to become a raja. To that end, is the moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
propitious for my taking upon myself the duties of
the Rani's secretary"?</p>

<p>The astrologer glanced slyly toward his client.</p>

<p>"For such work," he explained, "the fee is necessarily
higher than it was in forecasting your path toward
the position of a zemindar. The deeper an astrologer
is required to penetrate into futurity, the larger is the
sum he is compelled to ask for his services."</p>

<p>"Speak not of that," returned Bipin, grandiloquently.</p>

<p>"You may suppose that all the spoil of the Foreigners did
not escape my fingers. Name thy fee for disclosing my
way to become a raja."</p>

<p>The astrologer trading upon his client's vanity, named
an extravagantly high figure. For a moment Bipin
winced, but producing the money, he urged the astrologer
to lose no time in the matter.</p>

<p>For a space, the astrologer pored over a chart of the
heavens, muttering to himself unintelligibly; while Bipin
impatiently awaited the result.</p>

<p>At last the astrologer spoke in an abstracted manner.</p>

<p>"Thy way to become a raja, O Secretary, is clearly revealed,
but in thy path there stands a powerful enemy,
who is even now within the palace of the Rani."</p>

<p>Bipin's countenance lengthened considerably.</p>

<p>"Is it that accursed pundit, Krishna Lal"? he asked.</p>

<p>"His name is not so written upon the heavens," returned
the astrologer, "though its exact lettering I cannot
as yet discern. But he is himself a raja and detesteth
thee with all his soul."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>"Blessed Devi"! exclaimed Bipin, with nervous apprehension.
"What raja is there in the Rani's palace who
beareth me so much ill-will. I know of no such one."</p>

<p>"So far he hath screened his animosity under a mask
of kindness," replied the astrologer, returning to a scrutiny
of his chart. "But thy path is clearly set in contradiction
to his own. When they meet thou wilt be in
danger of bodily harm. Thou wilt not lose thy life," he
added, reassuringly, "but thou mayest be deprived of
some of thy organs&mdash;thy nose, and possibly thy ears, good
Secretary."</p>

<p>"Holy Kali," cried Bipin, impulsively raising his hand
to his terror-stricken face. "At such a price I have no
desire to be a raja. Nay, if such a danger encompasses
me, the Rani may find another secretary."</p>

<p>"Patience, patience, good sir," continued the astrologer.
"I did not say that there was no way of warding
off these evils. By following such advice as I can give
thee, thou mayest escape them all and yet live to be an
unmaimed raja."</p>

<p>"Tell me how, I pray thee, O learned Astrologer," besought
Bipin, with little trace of his importance remaining.</p>

<p>The astrologer appeared to reflect deeply before he
replied:</p>

<p>"First, thou wouldst do well," he enjoined, "to remain
in thy present service, because even if thou wert to
fly to the end of the earth, that which is written on the
heavens is bound to come to pass. But do thou carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
take note of everything in the palace, reporting each event
to me from time to time, so that when thy evil moment
approaches I can place before thee a sure defense. Especially
do thou regard the actions of a Hindu noble
recently arrived to join the Rani's cause. His looks I like
not, though they be fair outwardly."</p>

<p>"Thou canst not mean the Raja Prasad Singh"? asked
Bipin, in astonished accents.</p>

<p>"His name I cannot read as yet," returned the astrologer,
"but if his image rises to thy mind from what I
say, be assured he is the one who seeks to do thee so
much injury."</p>

<p>Then the astrologer put a question pointedly.</p>

<p>"Of this Raja Prasad, of whom you speak. Does he
stand close to the person of the Rani"?</p>

<p>"He is ever at her side," replied Bipin. "He seeks
to be appointed to the command of the troops in Jhansi."</p>

<p>The astrologer shook his head gravely.</p>

<p>"Come to me again shortly," he concluded. "Then I
will disclose to thee further. Remember to do as I have
counseled thee."</p>

<p>As the astrologer appeared to be about to withdraw
himself again into a state of profound abstraction. Bipin
promised to return at an early date. With misgiving in
place of elation in his heart, he left the house dejectedly.</p>

<p>"It seems to me," he reflected, as he made his way
thoughtfully along the alley. "It seems to me I have
gained little satisfaction by visiting that astrologer. For
twenty rupees I have found out that the Raja, Prasad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Singh, is an enemy who seeks to possess himself of my
nose and ears. Twenty rupees is a large sum to pay for
such information. What evil things might not the astrologer
have disclosed for fifty rupees? As to Prasad Singh,
he is evidently jealous of my influence with the Rani. I
must keep a close watch on him, and report to the astrologer
frequently."</p>

<p>Bipin had scarcely left the astrologer's presence, when
the curtain was thrust aside and Ahmad Khan stood in
the aperture.</p>

<p>"Well, noble sir," said the astrologer, "I think I reduced
that fool to a pliable state for our purpose."</p>

<p>Ahmad laughed sardonically.</p>

<p>"It is well," he replied. "No doubt his fears will temper
him into a useful tool. To-morrow I return to the
Rani's court in a new character. Keep my counsel, O
Mohurran, and thou shalt receive better pay than thou
ever didst before in thy musty calling, well recompensed
as I note it is. One thing we have gleaned from his
chatter. It was that dog of a Prasad who advised the
Rani to play me such a trick. He aspires to become commander
of the troops, does he? Well, he will yet be
obliged to seek his appointment at the hands of Ahmad
Khan, Raja of Jhansi."</p>

<h2>Chapter V<br />

<i>AHMAD RETURNS TO COURT</i></h2>


<p>The rains had burst over India with terrific force.
Even the arid and ever drought threatened
State of Jhansi received a deluge. This soon
rendered the main lines of communication impassable,
and cut Jhansi off from the outside world.</p>

<p>Rumors only of stirring events reached the Rani's ears.
In that mysterious way, by which news in India seems to
filter through inanimate channels, she heard of the Foreigner's
advance upon Delhi; but of the course which they
intended to pursue toward her own State, she could obtain
no reliable information. It appeared as if their desperate
need to strike a blow at the center of the revolt would
leave her unmolested for the present.</p>

<p>This was satisfactory as it gave her time to prepare for
their return. But her position was still precarious from
danger near at hand.</p>

<p>In the city of Jhansi her authority was now unquestioned,
even though the rivalries among her retainers made
it a delicate matter to enforce. But in the remaining parts
of the State, the nobles, uninfluenced by her personality,
were not so ready to submit to what they were inclined to
regard as the capricious rule of a girl. From similar instances
they feared the advent to power of some court
favorite. More than one, also, had claims of his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to urge forward to the prize that had fallen into the Rani's
grasp. With native caution they had waited for the result
of the <i>coup d'état</i> before irrevocably declaring their
own hands.</p>

<p>Thus, with the exception of a few minor nobles, the
Rani's proclamation of her accession had been received by
the Jhansi rajas throughout the State in ominous silence.
A disquieting report persistently reasserted that the
Maharaja Sadescheo, a cousin of the late Raja of Jhansi
was collecting troops near his fortress of Shahpur, for the
purpose of joining forces with the Peshwa. This did not
deceive the Rani's alert intelligence. A descent upon the
city of Jhansi was, in her reckoning, the Maharaja's more
probable aim.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances she had prudently secured
the gates and ramparts of Jhansi with her own soldiers,
leaving the fort and cantonments without the city in the
possession of Ahmad Khan, whose sullen attitude she
viewed with anxiety. While the Mohammedan noble
seemed to possess every evil trait to which mortal flesh is
heir, she fully appreciated the control of his ferocious
bravery, as an awe inspiring weapon to hold over the
heads of those who yet disputed her title.</p>

<p>His plea of sickness, as an excuse for his absence from
her court, if a ruse to screen other motives, was not confirmed
by any sign of action. She was led to hope, that
by the use of subtle influence, his allegiance might be retained
without making too great a sacrifice to his ambition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>How to accomplish this was the question of the hour.</p>

<p>The Rani was seated in one of her private apartments
discussing the news of the morning with Prasad, when
Bipin entered. He paused within the door, and glanced
suspiciously at the Hindu noble.</p>

<p>"Well, learned Secretary," greeted Prasad affably,
"Thy face seems to reflect the scowl of the elements.
Doth the weight of thy exalted office press too heavily
upon thy turban"?</p>

<p>"Thanks to the Rani's graciousness," returned Bipin,
"my turban rests lightly enough; and its folds well protect
my ears," he added significantly.</p>

<p>"He shall not imagine," thought Bipin, "that I am
not forewarned of his accursed design."</p>

<p>Prasad laughed good naturedly as he regarded the unusual
size of the secretary's head covering.</p>

<p>"It is almost large enough to protect thy nose as well,
good Bipin," he suggested.</p>

<p>The solemn expression on the secretary's face deepened
as he received what he believed to be sure confirmation
of the evil lurking in Prasad's mind.</p>

<p>"As the saying is, noble sir," he rejoined with an assumption
of sage gravity. "He who looks well to the
roof of his house need trouble little about an approaching
storm."</p>

<p>"Truly Bipin, thou art a philosopher," remarked the
Rani with a smile.</p>

<p>"Aye, always by thy favor, noble Lady," he answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"I keep a good watch not only upon my nose and ears,
but upon all my other possessions."</p>

<p>The secretary concluded this passage of words with
a wary look directed toward Prasad. He then advanced
and delivered a missive to the Rani.</p>

<p>"From the Maharaja Sadescheo of Shahpur," he said,
bowing. "A messenger hath just delivered it at the
palace."</p>

<p>The Rani took the letter eagerly.</p>

<p>"Ah," she exclaimed. "Now we shall know whether
Sadescheo's newly acquired martial spirit leads him to
join the Peshwa. If I mistake not, his avarice prompts
him to cast longing eyes upon the revenues of Jhansi.
It is a treasure chest rather than honor which men like
Sadescheo crave."</p>

<p>She hastily opened the letter and gathered its contents.</p>

<p>"Go," she cried with a commanding air, to Bipin.
"Go, but remain within call, as I may need thy services."</p>

<p>When Bipin had retired, she handed the letter to
Prasad.</p>

<p>"Read that, my Lord," she exclaimed. "We need no
longer remain in doubt as to Sadescheo's reason for collecting
troops. He reminds me that as the late Raja's
cousin he is entitled to some voice in the settlement of
affairs, and that until I have been proclaimed in a <i>Darbar</i>
of the Jhansi nobles, he cannot recognize my right to
inherit the throne. The fool! the fool"! she continued
passionately. "How many of them are there to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
taught that the power of Lachmi Bai doth not rest upon
the will of nobles, but in her own spirit, and in the love
of her people."?</p>

<p>Prasad, in turn, read the letter, and then tossed it contemptuously
from him.</p>

<p>"Who is this Sadescheo that presumes to question your
authority"? he demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh," she returned with a gesture of disdain. "Maharaja
Sadescheo possesses a fortress at Shahpur. He
hath some followers; but he would never have dared to
address me in this fashion had Ahmad Khan remained
at my side. I fear he must have received some hint of
the Mohammedan's defection."</p>

<p>"Ah! Ahmad Khan! Ahmad Khan"! Prasad ejaculated
impatiently. "His name is ever sounding in my ears."</p>

<p>He rose abruptly and passed to one of the windows
where he gazed angrily out upon the lowering clouds,
that swept across the sky, at intervals drenching the land
with cyclonic violence.</p>

<p>Then as if a resolution was suddenly formed in his
mind, he returned to the Rani's side and besought her
in fervent accents.</p>

<p>"Fair Rani," he cried. "Why speakest thou so much
of this Ahmad Khan? Surely thou canst no longer hold
him in thy favor. One look upon his surly countenance
and thou beholdest treachery marked by every line. Of
this, recently thou hast had ample proof. But give me,
ah, dear lady, I implore thee, give into my hands the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
command of thy troops, and thou shalt see how quickly
I will subdue this presumptuous Maharaja."</p>

<p>The Rani smiled approvingly upon his eager countenance,
but shook her head negatively.</p>

<p>"Prasad, well do I believe in thy devotion and courage,
but thou art hasty in judgment. Consider how rash
would be thy action. Thou wouldst carry my troops
away to Shahpur, and leave me&mdash;to whom wouldst thou
leave the defense of the city? To Ahmad's soldiers? Nay
surely! No," she added thoughtfully. "In my mind all
such work without the city must fall to Ahmad's lot. But
how to control his savage nature, for the moment, I see
not clearly."</p>

<p>Prasad again paced to a little distance. An expression
of keen disappointment settled on his face.</p>

<p>"Nay Prasad," she enjoined in a gentle voice. "Be
not out of humor with me. Thou dost not rightly see
these things. Thou dost not understand what bitter jealousy
would be stirred up among my own people, if I gave
to thee that which many worthy officers covet most. Ahmad
may be a greater villain than even thou wouldst have
him, but forget not he goes to battle with greater zest
than to a banquet. Bloodshed and rapine are his calling,
and few there are who do not shudder at his name. Ah!
If I could only send him forth to this impertinent Sadescheo."</p>

<p>"Is it possible thou, too, art afraid of him"? suggested
Prasad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>A laugh of derision escaped the Rani's lips.</p>

<p>"Lachmi Bai afraid of Ahmad&mdash;of anyone? Nay, you
know her not, O Prasad."</p>

<p>The Hindu noble's intense jealousy prompted him to
an ungallant retort. He turned quickly toward her and
muttered between his clenched teeth:</p>

<p>"Perchance thou art in love with the Mohammedan"?</p>

<p>She rose to her feet and stood confronting him; her
form quivering with emotion; her cheeks aflame; her
eyes flashing threateningly; her breast throbbing with
the insult.</p>

<p>"Dare not thou ever speak to me again such thought,"
she retorted sternly. "Dost think that I, of noble birth
and lofty caste, would descend to gratify the passion of
an accursed Moslem, even if he could place upon my
head an empire's crown. Dost think&mdash;Ah, Prasad,"
she continued in a softer tone. "Thou art surely out of
thy mind to speak thus to me. Thou hast forgotten that
although I am the Rani, I am still a woman. I did not
think this of thee."</p>

<p>Her voice quavered as the passion roused by the insult
to her dignity gave place to a realization of the
wound made, by one, for whom she had come to form
a tender regard.</p>

<p>Prasad glanced at the eyes from which the fire had
been quenched by gathering tears. He was seized with
contrition, and cast himself abjectly at her feet.</p>

<p>"Ah! Beast that I am," he cried in accents of self reproach.
"How dare I throw a doubt upon thine honor?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Forgive me. Forgive my folly, thou dear one. Surely
thou knowest it is my love for thee, which maketh me
hate the very name of any other uttered by thy matchless
lips. I vow it is my only desire to do thee service,
aye, if it be the will of God, to give my life for thee."</p>

<p>She rested a hand gently upon his shoulder, and gazed
down upon him with affection.</p>

<p>"This time thou art forgiven," she returned. "But
distress me not so again, my Prasad. Thou shall yet do me
not unrequited service, if thou canst be unresentful of
the means I am compelled to use to make my will obeyed.
If thou seest me take in hand a two edged sword, be
assured it is the best weapon I can find to parry disloyalty
in both Hindu and Mohammedan."</p>

<p>"So be it, fair lady," he replied. "Thou art my will,
my life."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and for the moment was tempted
by an uncontrollable desire to enfold her in his arms. He
took a hurried pace forward, but the act was prevented
by the entrance of a woman servant.</p>

<p>"My Lady Rani," the latter announced. "Ahmad
Khan hath come to the palace. He urgently craves an
audience with your Highness."</p>

<p>The Rani's face expressed welcome surprise.</p>

<p>"So," she cried. "Ahmad returns to caress the hand
that sways his destiny. Fierce beast that he is. I&mdash;I
am his mistress, aye, his master.</p>

<p>"Come," she added, beckoning to Prasad. "Be watchful
of thy temper, O good friend."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Rani entered the room in which Ahmad was
waiting, he saluted her with profound reverence. Thrice
he made a courtly <i>salaam</i> at a respectful distance. In his
outward manner there was no sign of the arrogance which
had marked his last abrupt entrance into her palace.</p>

<p>Whatever conclusion the Rani drew from the glance
directed toward him, she extended a friendly greeting.
"Thou art welcome, Ahmad," she exclaimed, intimating
her pleasure that he should draw nearer. "Thou art
ever welcome to the Palace of the Rani. I trust thou
art recovered from thy sickness."</p>

<p>"Noble Lady," he replied, as if with an effort. "The
physician had enjoined a longer period of confinement
to my room; but the news from Shahpur made me hasten
to thy side."</p>

<p>The Rani started.</p>

<p>"Hast thou heard from Sadescheo then"? she asked
wistfully.</p>

<p>"Of him rather than from him, noble Lady," replied
Ahmad. "Sadescheo gathers troops about his fortress,
so it is thy humble servant's advice that thou dost, without
loss of time, dispatch a strong body to learn his
reason."</p>

<p>The Rani turned a searching look upon the Mohammedan.</p>

<p>He met her gaze unflinchingly.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"Noble Rani," he petitioned. "Thou hast good cause
to doubt my faith and word. But, gracious Lady, hear
my explanation. True is it that Bahadur Shah commanded
me to protect the Government of Jhansi, but
surely for thy sake. My people were carried away by
their zeal and triumph over the Foreigners. They were
guilty of an offense against thy authority. In the same
enthusiasm of the hour I, too, lost control of my proper
reverence for thy person. For this, noble Rani, I do
seek thy pardon; and as evidence of my regret, I beg
that thou wilt direct me to march instantly with three
hundred Afghan troopers, who have arrived this morning
without the city, and demand submission of this
Sadescheo. Be assured if he does not comply speedily,
I will rout his people like sheep before a band of wolves.
In chains, at my horse's hoofs, will I drag him and his
relatives hither."</p>

<p>While Prasad gazed with wonder at the Mohammedan's
altered manner, the Rani assured him that the past had
already been forgotten.</p>

<p>"Then will I set forth for Shahpur, noble Rani," he
asked, "to bring this dog of a Maharaja to his senses"?</p>

<p>"Not so hastily, my Lord," the Rani answered thoughtfully.
"The sword once out of its sheath, the fight is
on, and who knows what a turmoil we may stir up in the
state. Wiser it would seem to me, to overawe Sadescheo
by a display of greater force. How many people,
think you, hath he already collected to his support"?</p>

<p>"Noble Lady," replied the Mohammedan, "I know,
nor care not. But give to me the order and with a hundred
Afghans to every thousand of his people few will
remain in Shahpur to tell of Ahmad's visit."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ahmad, good friend," replied the Rani authoritatively.
"That must not be. Well do I know and appreciate
thy courage, but bloodshed among ourselves is what
I strive to avoid."</p>

<p>"Better to crush the cobra before it raises its head,"
he remarked significantly.</p>

<p>"Aye, but I would rather that with thy Afghan horsemen,
thou dost take an equal number of my troopers.
Then will Sadescheo perceive that both Hindu and Mohammedan
are united in my cause, and will submit without
resort to force."</p>

<p>Ahmad appeared to coincide with her argument.</p>

<p>"Thou speakest ever wisely, O Rani," he returned.
"But in such event might not I ask that the noble
Prasad Singh here, doth lead thy troops, if he will deign
the comradeship of so rough a man at arms."</p>

<p>Prasad looked up eagerly at the unexpected request,
and implied compliment. He began to view Ahmad in
a different light.</p>

<p>"With the Rani's permission, gladly will I do so," he
acquiesced.</p>

<p>The Rani perceived that Prasad's presence with the
expedition might act as a restraining influence, as well
as a safeguard upon the Mohammedan.</p>

<p>She gave her consent readily.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt take three hundred of my horsemen," she
addressed Prasad, "and accompany Ahmad Khan to
Shahpur. Upon thy return a <i>Darbar</i> shall be held in
which I will make the chief appointments in the state."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>She then turned to Ahmad and asked if it would be
possible for him to reach Shahpur in the present state
of the weather.</p>

<p>"Fair Lady," replied the Mohammedan. "Have I
not fought among the Afghan passes when the winter
snows were tinged a bloody red. Have I not chased Kurd
horsemen into their bleak fastnesses. Such squalls as
these but refresh the mettle of our steeds. Fear not, at
daybreak, Ahmad Khan will break his fast with Sadescheo."</p>

<p>"Then farewell, my Lords," the Rani cried. "Go,
terrify Sadescheo as much as thou wilt, but, remember,
draw not the sword unless thou art compelled as thou
regardest my favor."</p>

<p>Ahmad saluted and retired first from her presence.
Prasad was about to follow, when he paused a moment.</p>

<p>"What are thy commands"? he asked in a low tone,
as if he expected an order yet to be disclosed.</p>

<p>"Be watchful," she replied. "For the present he may
be trusted, because"&mdash;</p>

<p>A smile of triumph broke upon her face as she concluded&mdash;</p>

<p>"If thou dost love the Rani, remember her command."</p>

<p>She passed to a window and watched the two nobles
mount their chargers. Her spirit was stirred by the sight
of their martial bearing.</p>

<p>"Ah"! she sighed regretfully. "Ah! How I would
like to be one of them. To be a man and ride forth
sword in hand, to battle; to hear the cannon roar, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
mingle with the clash of arms. Perhaps, who can tell,
some day the Rani may command her troops in person."</p>

<p>Then her thoughts took another channel.</p>

<p>"Sadescheo," she exclaimed. "Sadescheo! Poor,
foolish, coward. I have no fear how he will act when
the dawn finds Ahmad demanding admittance, in my
name, at the gates of Shahpur."</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<h2>Chapter VI<br />
<i>THE OATH</i></h2>

<p>Faithfully Ahmad kept his word to the Rani.
Through the black, tempestuous night, he
swept over the road to Shahpur. He recklessly
plunged into swollen torrents. He callously
hurled himself upon whatever obstacles lay in his path.
Whirlwinds and stormbursts seemed in sympathy with his
furious nature, bearing him onward rather than impeding
his progress. Struggling, swearing, crashing in his wake,
the troopers followed as best they could. A horse falling
through sheer exhaustion, rider and beast were left to
extricate themselves. Another, carried away in the flood
of a river, was, without a saving effort, abandoned to his
fate. To Ahmad, such incidents were only manifestations
of the Will of Allah, by which all men must die
when their appointed hour had come.</p>

<p>This exhibition of splendid recklessness was not without
effect upon the brave spirit of Prasad. With rigid
features he strenuously spurred forward at Ahmad's side.
In his mind there gradually formed an understanding of
the value which the Rani placed upon the services of the
Mohammedan. It was like a bolt of lightning held in
reserve, a force to be controlled only with the greatest
skill and prudence; yet one that launched forth, burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
to destroy, and oblivious of meeting with destruction itself;
a terrible and awe-inspiring object.</p>

<p>Seldom were words exchanged. A guttural oath occasionally
burst from the Mohammedan's lips as he found
his way momentarily blockaded; an exclamation of anger
went forth upon the night as he glanced back over his
shoulder to discover that his pace had outstripped that
of his followers.</p>

<p>The sullen break of day found Ahmad Khan and his
companions, shaggy, dirt begrimed, with sodden garments,
emerging from a ravine. At the entrance, perched
upon the summit of a rock, rose indistinctly in the misty
half light, the gray walls of the citadel of Shahpur.</p>

<p>He halted his men for a short space to enable stragglers
to rejoin the party, and to perform a religious act. In
Ahmad's nature, there was mingled with an absolute lack
of human principle, a strange leavening of superstitious
reverence. The more villainous the project upon which
he was bent, the more scrupulous would he be in conforming
to certain outward observances of his religion. If a
murder was to be accomplished by the basest treachery,
he would as fervently call down the blessing of Allah
upon the act, as if another were about to sacrifice himself
in some deed of true heroism.</p>

<p>He unrolled a small piece of carpet, and spread it upon
the ground. Then he knelt with his face toward the west,
and remained a few minutes in prayer.</p>

<p>"There is but one God and Mohammed is the Prophet
of God," he solemnly ejaculated at its conclusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Several of his troopers added an amen.</p>

<p>He rose and remounted.</p>

<p>He then carefully inspected the company, arranging
them in double file. This done to his satisfaction he cautiously
led the way toward the mouth of the ravine, taking
advantage of such cover as was afforded by the low underbrush
and projecting spurs of rock.</p>

<p>Ahmad thus advanced into a narrow sinuous path leading
up to the main gate of the citadel, when he pressed
forward so rapidly and noiselessly, that he was demanding
admittance of the keeper, before the watchers on the
walls had discerned his approach.</p>

<p>"Open there," he shouted, "to Ahmad Khan and the
noble Prasad Singh, bearing a message from the Rani of
Jhansi."</p>

<p>Ahmad Khan! Ahmad Khan! A panic seized those
within the gates roused from their slumbers by the stentorian
voice of the Mohammedan.</p>

<p>"Open dogs," he thundered, as his summons failed of
an immediate response.</p>

<p>"Noble lords," at last came a quavering rejoinder.
"Maharaja Sadescheo yet sleepeth. The gates cannot
be opened without his order."</p>

<p>"Wake him then," cried the Mohammedan. "By
God's holy Prophet, time passes upon an urgent
matter."</p>

<p>"Noble lords, that is impossible."</p>

<p>"Accursed jackals. Am I to batter down the gate.
Go to thy master, and if thou wilt, lay all the blame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
on Ahmad Khan. He will awaken quickly, enough, if I
mistake not," he added.</p>

<p>A short period elapsed, passed restlessly by Ahmad,
when the voice was again raised within the gate.</p>

<p>"Maharaja Sadescheo extends greeting. He would
welcome the noble Ahmad Khan and his followers but
that the citadel is already over filled. If the noble Ahmad
Khan will enter unattended, then will Sadescheo gladly
see him."</p>

<p>Ahmad cast himself impulsively from the saddle.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt not accept this challenge, surely"? asked
Prasad.</p>

<p>"Surely will I," the other retorted. "Thou wilt keep
these fellows here, and if I do not return or send for thee
within an hour, thou canst ask the reason by an assault
upon the gate. But there is no danger."</p>

<p>He passed through the massive door and found himself
in a courtyard filled with Sadescheo's recently collected
soldiers. As he strode inward fearlessly, they fell back
before his grim and martial bearing. His way made clear
through these, he was conducted to a room in the interior
of the fortress to await the Maharaja.</p>

<p>With soldierly instinct Ahmad stepped to a window
that commanded a partial view of the defenses.</p>

<p>"A good position," he reflected, as his glance swept
along the walls, "and worth holding if garrisoned by a
handful of Mohammedans instead of this Hindu rabble.
Sadescheo"!&mdash;</p>

<p>A smile broke upon his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sadescheo thinks to trick the Rani of Jhansi. By God!
he little knows with whom he has to deal. She would
make a fit wife even for the illustrious Dost Mohammed,
the Lion of Afghanistan. I warrant there is more in that
bewitching form than most give credit for. Thus, for
the undoing of this accursed Prasad, will Ahmad for a
time become her humble slipper bearer. Allah! what
is it in the girl that moves a man in spite of himself."</p>

<p>A voice pronouncing his name interrupted the trend
of his thoughts. He turned abruptly to confront a man
of past middle age, whose weak features bore evidence
of a life of sensual debauchery. With outstretched hands
Sadescheo greeted the Mohammedan.</p>

<p>"Thou hast come unexpectedly, and apparently without
waste of time upon the road, O Ahmad," he exclaimed,
eyeing the Mohammedan's travel-stained attire.
Then in a lower tone, "Hast determined to assist in ousting
that chit of a girl from the Raj of Jhansi"?</p>

<p>Ahmad drew himself up to his full height as he replied
haughtily.</p>

<p>"I have come from Her Highness the Rani to know the
reason of your collecting troops, and to demand a recognition
of her authority."</p>

<p>"Come! come! Good Ahmad," the other rejoined. "It
is early in the day for pleasantry. It is a new thing for
Ahmad Khan to joke."</p>

<p>"A joke," repeated Ahmad sternly. "By the Prophet's
beard it is no joke. On the Koran I have sworn to support
the Rani."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The feeble smile on Sadescheo's face gave place to an
expression of dismay.</p>

<p>"Thou canst not mean this," he returned, "for but the
other day thou didst send a messenger agreeing to our
plans."</p>

<p>"And to-day," retorted Ahmad threateningly, "I come
in person to denounce that same messenger as a liar.
Briefly, good friend, it doth not suit Ahmad Khan to
oppose the Rani for the purpose of uplifting Sadescheo."</p>

<p>"Then thou hast surely chosen an ill-fitting place to
make the declaration," replied the Maharaja significantly.
"Perchance Ahmad Khan may remain in Shahpur until
he again finds it expedient to change his mind. He does
not seem to be aware that he speaks within the walls
of Sadescheo's fortress."</p>

<p>With a rapid movement Ahmad was at Sadescheo's
side. Roughly he laid a firm grasp upon the Maharaja's
shoulder, while his disengaged hand fell to the hilt of a
dagger protruding from his girdle.</p>

<p>"Aye, and thou art in Ahmad's power," he muttered
fiercely. "If he sees fit to change his mind, that is his
affair. If he orders thee to throw open thy gates to his
people, three hundred Afghans and as many of the Rani's
troopers, impatient to enter, yea or nay, and summon
hither his lieutenant, thou hadst better do it quickly, or
he will open thy body and toss forth thy chicken heart
to swine. Art willing to follow such advice, valiant Sadescheo"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>Sadescheo glanced timorously toward the open door.
Within call were a dozen armed retainers who at the
raising of his voice would rush to his assistance. But
he knew full well that before they could reach his side,
Ahmad's dagger would be buried a foot deep in his breast.
If in turn, the Mohammedan were slain after he had made
a pile of corpses to fall upon, that would be little satisfaction
to him personally. He therefore called an attendant
and gave the required order. For a moment the
servant hesitated. "Go," cried Sadescheo nervously.
"Go do my bidding, swiftly. What would you have
now"? he asked of Ahmad.</p>

<p>"That my troops receive food and lodging for the day,"
replied the other, "and that on my return to Jhansi to-night
my lieutenant, Suliman Abhas and a hundred Afghans
replace your people on the walls of the citadel.
Further, thou wilt proclaim the Rani in <i>Darbar</i> and hoist
her banner on the gate."</p>

<p>To this Sadescheo made a gesture indicative of enforced
compliance.</p>

<p>Presently, heavy footsteps in the passage announced
the approach of Prasad and Ahmad's lieutenant.</p>

<p>Upon entering they glanced from Sadescheo, still held
in Ahmad's grasp, to their leader, and waited.</p>

<p>With grim ceremony he presented them to the Maharaja.</p>

<p>Sadescheo bade them a reluctant welcome.</p>

<p>"With your permission, noble sir," suggested Ahmad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
"we will proceed to your hall of audience. There the
Rani's title will be proclaimed, and we will rest upon our
return to Jhansi."</p>

<p>Before an hour had passed the Rani of Jhansi's banner
was flying beside that of Sadescheo, and Ahmad's troops
had replaced those of the Maharaja on the walls.</p>

<p>That night the two nobles set forth on their return to
the capital.</p>

<p>The burst of the monsoon in Jhansi had for the time
passed over, so they rode leisurely through the clear atmosphere.
First, they discussed the general prospects of
the rebellion, then their successful descent upon Sadescheo,
and lastly the condition of their personal affairs.</p>

<p>"You carried your life upon the blade of your sword,
when you entered Sadescheo's fortress," remarked Prasad
admiringly. "It was an intrepid act."</p>

<p>Ahmad laughed carelessly.</p>

<p>"In truth no," he returned. "There are some men,
I grant you, with whom it would have been a venturesome
thing to do. It would be a dangerous trick to play
upon such a one as Dost Mohammed, whose valour and
resource rise with the greater odds against him. But
with this Sadescheo"&mdash;</p>

<p>He uttered an exclamation of contempt as he concluded:</p>

<p>"Upon him you have but to frown, and he shivers
from his turban to his slippers."</p>

<p>They rode on in silence for some distance across a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
wide plain, the troopers following in a long procession,
phantom like by the light of the moon.</p>

<p>Ahmad, apparently deep in thought, at last spoke in a
reflective manner.</p>

<p>"Thou art a fortunate man, friend Prasad. Providence
hath undoubtedly taken thy affairs into her special keeping."</p>

<p>"How so"? the other asked. "If by casting obstacles
at every turn of my way she is doing me good service,
then only am I the most fortunate of men."</p>

<p>"Why, good comrade," returned Ahmad. "Is it not
great fortune to stand so high in the beautiful Rani's
favor. What could man desire more"?</p>

<p>Prasad turned a glance quickly upon the Mohammedan,
but his companion's head was bent downward toward the
pommel of his saddle.</p>

<p>"If I stand high in her favor," he replied, "then she
well keepeth it a secret."</p>

<p>"Dost thou not count it a favor"? asked the Mohammedan,
"to be appointed to the supreme command
of her troops when many crave so honorable a post."</p>

<p>"She hath not appointed me to any office," replied
Prasad, "except upon this expedition, which was owing
to thy suggestion."</p>

<p>Ahmad raised his face upon which rested a well feigned
look of surprise.</p>

<p>"Truly you astonish me," he exclaimed. "But the
Rani is a prudent woman, and doubtless waits a favorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
moment to give it to thee. At the <i>Darbar</i> she will
probably pronounce thy name in honor."</p>

<p>"I doubt it much," returned Prasad, "though I grant
you she is a mistress in the art of not making clear her
mind."</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," ejaculated Ahmad soothingly. "Woman
like, she is but playing with thee awhile. But I know
well she holdeth thee in high esteem. How could she do
otherwise than appreciate the gallantry of so fine a
soldier. For me," he added indifferently, "I possess little
influence with the Rani, and at any moment I may be
called away to set the Emperor's house in order. But
when I make my report of this little business, be assured
I will not fail to keep thy name in mind. If a humble
word of mine can do thee service, it shall not remain
unspoken."</p>

<p>The eyes of the two men met in a steady gaze. Upon
the Mohammedan's face stern and cold as it appeared,
Prasad could detect no sign of hidden motive. He had
yielded homage to the man's reckless valor; might there
not, he argued, after all dwell beneath the rough exterior,
a generous nature, carried away at times by mad impulse.</p>

<p>"If thou wouldst do this for me," he returned, "thou
wilt have placed me under obligation of a life. To command
the Rani's troops is now my great ambition."</p>

<p>For an instant a sarcastic smile flickered about the
Mohammedan's lips. But it was gone before it could
be detected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Gladly will I take an oath upon the holy book to
do it," he answered. "These officers of the Rani are
well enough, but they lack that proper martial spirit which,
as a soldier, I have noted plainly in thy conduct. For
myself, my aims now lie elsewhere than in Jhansi; but
even were that not so, I would willingly yield to thee the
office, as it is but right a Hindu noble should command
the forces of a Hindu queen."</p>

<p>"Ahmad," Prasad cried enthusiastically. "I have done
thee an injustice. More, I have ever done the same as
those of thy religion. It is said a Moslem can never be
a friend. Henceforth I vow that such is false."</p>

<p>Ahmad bowed his head in acknowledgment of the
other's confidence.</p>

<p>"Everyone hath an enemy," he replied, "who will
misrepresent a good intention. If influence of mine can
do thee service, by the holy <i>Kaaba</i> I swear the Rani will
go into <i>Darbar</i> with but thy name upon her lips.</p>

<p>"Come! The day breaks," he concluded, "and we
are still some leagues from Jhansi."</p>

<p>Again he halted to dismount and pray with his face
toward holy Mecca.</p>

<p>Ahmad's devotions were of short duration. He concluded
with a petition to Allah to witness the truth in
his heart. Then vaulting into the saddle, he drove his
spurs into his horse's flanks. With arms glinting in the
sunshine, at a canter, he bravely led the cavalcade.</p>

<h2>Chapter VII<br />

<i>HOW AHMAD KEPT HIS OATH</i></h2>

<p>Ahmad returned alone to the Rani's palace. To
avert all suspicion of his conduct, he dismissed
his Afghans to the cantonments on approaching
the city. With the plea of furthering Prasad's
interest, he had advised the Hindu noble to absent himself
when the report of their expedition was made. It
would be difficult, he explained, to properly advocate the
claim of another, if the person chiefly concerned were
present.</p>

<p>Prasad clearly perceived the force of the Mohammedan's
suggestion. He relied implicitly upon the other's
good faith, and readily acquiesced.</p>

<p>"Make my best <i>salaams</i> to the divine Rani," he enjoined
Ahmad on parting, "and say that I will come to
her side as soon as I have changed my attire for garments
more suitable to the presence of a queen."</p>

<p>Ahmad vowed that he would leave no compliment unsaid
on Prasad's behalf.</p>

<p>"In truth," he reflected, as he proceeded on his way, "I
may be wrong, but this Rani of ours seems rather to prefer
the smell of powder to the most delicate perfume of
Teheran. I fancy the courtier finds less favor in her
eyes than the man-at-arms. Ah what a treasure! What an
<i>houri</i>. She must, by the God of Islam, she shall be mine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
if I am compelled to play a hundred different parts in
turn."</p>

<p>As Ahmad dismounted, the beggar who had petitioned
everyone entering the palace that morning, ceased his cry
for alms. He crouched further into his corner as instinct
told him it was the fierce Mohammedan at hand&mdash;one
whose boast was that he neither feared nor pitied any
human being.</p>

<p>Ahmad remarked the beggar's action.</p>

<p>"Thou poor wretch," said he in a voice into which he
threw as much compassion as he could assume. "Art
dumb now as well as blind."?</p>

<p>Surprise was depicted on the face of the beggar, who
had learned by past experience to expect a curse if he ventured
to address Ahmad Khan.</p>

<p>"Noble Lord," he faltered. "Is it truly the voice
of the great Ahmad that I hear"?</p>

<p>"Whose voice else"? demanded the Mohammedan in
return.</p>

<p>The beggar shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Lord I know not," he answered.</p>

<p>Ahmad cast a small coin at the beggar's feet, and ascended
the palace steps.</p>

<p>On the porch Bipin had been an interested spectator
of the scene.</p>

<p>"Blessed Devi," he reflected. "What next will happen?
Perchance we shall behold Ahmad Khan robed as
a <i>Mollah</i> calling his people to prayer, from the balcony
of a minaret. Everyone seems to be what he is not. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
think that the well-looking Prasad should possess so villainous
a heart, and the black Mohammedan display compassion
for the unfortunate."</p>

<p>Bipin was still in a most unhappy frame of mind. That
morning another circumstance had occurred fraught with
ill-omen. A white cat bereft of one eye had persistently
endeavored to sharpen its talons in his legs. To fathom
the significance of the beast's actions, Bipin had promptly
repaired to his friend the astrologer, who for a monetary
consideration, had assured his client that they betokened
the swift unfolding of Prasad's design. As a consequence,
Bipin had armed himself with an ancient and
rusty flint lock pistol, the massive butt of which protruded
from his waistband.</p>

<p>The weapon at once attracted Ahmad's notice.</p>

<p>"What," he cried with gruff humor. "What do I
behold? The worthy Bipin Dat, the man of peace, armed
for mortal combat."</p>

<p>"Illustrious Lord," returned Bipin gravely. "When
every man goeth armed, he is a fool who doth not follow
the prevailing fashion."</p>

<p>"True, O Secretary," returned Ahmad, laying a familiar
though heavy hand upon the other's shoulder.
"Come, I like thee all the better for thy display of spirit.
Soon thou wilt be wielding a sword with the best Afghan
in my troop."</p>

<p>"And why should I not," rejoined Bipin. "One need
not be born in a fortress to make a good fighter."</p>

<p>Ahmad threw back his head and laughed heartily. "Bipin,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
he replied, "I am inclined to think thou hast mistaken
thy calling. Thou shouldst have been a soldier.
Come! I will beg a commission for thee from Her Highness,
so that thou mayest win the title, <i>Singh</i>."</p>

<p>"Not so fast, good sir," replied Bipin. "In dangerous
times arms are well enough for protection, but he who
makes a profession of exchanging blows receives too many
for my liking."</p>

<p>Ahmad laughed again. "Well! well! Bipin," he exclaimed.
"I make no doubt when the moment comes
thou wilt acquit thyself with the best of us. But in the
meantime I would see the Heaven endowed Rani."</p>

<p>Bipin turned, and beckoned Ahmad to follow. He led
the way into the palace.</p>

<p>The Rani had feared that in spite of the solemn injunction
she had laid upon Ahmad, his uncontrolled nature
might have led him into some overt act against Sadescheo.
She was relieved, early in the report, to learn,
that he had managed to enforce her authority upon the
Maharaja without igniting a racial conflagration within
her territory.</p>

<p>"Ahmad," she cried with a display of satisfaction.
"Thou hast done well indeed. How can I reward thy
services sufficiently"?</p>

<p>"Noble Rani," he answered. "Thy approval of my
actions is all the recompense I ask."</p>

<p>A momentary expression of added relief crossed the
Rani's face.</p>

<p>She was afraid he might demand that which his soldierly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
qualities entitled him to claim, but which she still hesitated
to give.</p>

<p>"If all others were only like thee," she returned, "how
much easier would be my lot, how much more secure
would be our position."</p>

<p>"Fair Lady," resumed Ahmad. "My position is uncertain,
for I know not how soon I may be called away
to sharpen the blunted teeth of Bahadur Shah's overfed
soldiers. Wrangling among themselves over the plunder
that has fallen into their hands at Delhi, they will scatter
to the jungle like a band of jackals at the voice of the
Foreign hunter. But if Ahmad Khan might presume to
offer the great Rani some advice in certain matters, he
would consider himself well repaid for any service he has
rendered."</p>

<p>"Gladly will I hear thee, friend Ahmad," acquiesced
the Rani.</p>

<p>"Principally is it," continued Ahmad, "in reference to
the offices thou wilt doubtless make in <i>Darbar</i> to-morrow.
Above all things it would be advisable to appoint a commander
of the troops, to whom both thy Hindu and Mohammedan
subjects will look with respect and confidence.
If thou hast determined this already, then will the voice
of thy humble servant remain silent."</p>

<p>"No Ahmad," returned the Rani thoughtfully. "I
have not done so as yet. That matter troubles me more
than all else. There are so many worthy aspirants that
it is difficult to select the one who would suit the office
best. Willingly will I listen to thy advice."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, noble Rani," Ahmad proceeded, "Taking into
account the conflicting aspects of the question, the man
to be chosen must possess more than one qualification.
Courage and daring must first of all be his birthright,
but equally important is a knowledge of military strategy&mdash;none
the less valuable if intuitive rather than acquired
by experience, and in which rapidity of action must be
the outward manifestation of an alert mind. To these
must be added firmness of character to enforce discipline
even to the point of seeming cruelty, holding human life
in his own person and in that of others as of no account
when necessary, yet not unmindful of the needs of his
soldiers whose affection he will thereby gain in return.
If, further, he should possess youth and a gallant bearing
it will be to his advantage, for the trooper is ever the more
eager to follow a captain of distinguished presence. If
he possesses these qualities, noble Rani, even though thy
selection were to fall upon a comparative stranger to the
state, be assured thou wouldst act most wisely. Such a
one I dare to have in mind."</p>

<p>Unconsciously Ahmad had faithfully portrayed the
character as yet undisplayed of the girl before whom he
stood.</p>

<p>In the pause which ensued it was evident the Rani was
mentally reviewing the faces of those known to her who
would be most likely to coincide with Ahmad's description.</p>

<p>"Ah"! she exclaimed at last. "Dost thou refer to
Prasad Singh"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>A look of slight astonishment broke upon Ahmad's
face.</p>

<p>"Prasad Singh"! he ejaculated. "Noble Lady," he
protested, "for aught I know to the contrary Prasad
Singh <i>may</i> possess all these qualities and more. Untried
in any important affair, he <i>may</i> prove to be a great captain,
though in our little ride to Shahpur, but for the banter
of his rough companion, I think he would more than
once have turned back. But Prasad surely is a good
comrade and a handsome fellow, even if his name doth
not hover on my lips."</p>

<p>"Whose name dost thou have in mind, then"? asked
the Rani somewhat perplexed.</p>

<p>"It is the young officer Dost Ali, noble Lady," replied
Ahmad confidentially. "Thou wilt have heard his father
was a Maratha who was driven into exile by the Foreigners,
and dying left his young son to the protection
of the illustrious Dost Mohammed. Brought up by such
a leader, he has well learned the trade of arms. By
birth a Hindu and a Mohammedan by adoption, both
factions in the state might well unite to serve under him.
Moreover, such action on thy part would surely please
the great Amir of Afghanistan, some of whose troopers
are now a part of thy forces, and whose doubtful attitude
toward the Foreigners might thereby be determined in
support of India's cause."</p>

<p>The Rani turned from Ahmad and gazed out of a window
pensively. There was forming quickly in her mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
an ulterior object that might be promoted by following
Ahmad's suggestion. Among her older officers there was
a marked disposition to regard her opinion in military
affairs lightly, as that of a mere girl whose judgment in
such matters could be of no value. A younger man,
susceptible to her personal charm, would, she thought,
be more likely to follow, unhesitatingly, the dictates of
her will.</p>

<p>"Thou hast observed the young officer of whom I
speak, my Rani"? Ahmad asked with a shade of anxiety
in his voice, as he waited on her answer.</p>

<p>"Truly I have," she answered. "I have remarked
him well several times. I like his manner and appearance.
There is much discernment in what thou sayest.
For a space I will think over it, and to-morrow make
known my decision."</p>

<p>Ahmad <i>salaamed</i> low and withdrew from her presence.</p>

<p>So far, he was satisfied with the favorable view the
Rani seemed to take of his covert plan of installing a
<i>protégé</i> of his own in one of the most important offices
of the government, and the deeper project of eventually
destroying his rival by that means.</p>

<p>The Rani proceeded to an inner court, and called her
chief waiting woman to her side.</p>

<p>"Rati," she began. "I am curious to know what other
women&mdash;the ladies of the <i>zananas</i>&mdash;think of me. Tell
me, O Rati, thou who learnest such things, what is the
opinion in such places of Lachmi Bai"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl looked nonplussed.</p>

<p>"Speak truly," enjoined the Rani. "Flattery enough I
can have for the wish."</p>

<p>The girl's uneasiness increased visibly.</p>

<p>"Noble Rani. They say. They say"&mdash;she hesitated.</p>

<p>"Yes, what do they say"? the Rani demanded impatiently.</p>

<p>"That thou art well gifted, O noble one," the girl replied
evasively.</p>

<p>The Rani turned a look of displeasure upon the girl.
"I did not ask for that," she spoke authoritatively.
"Tell me what else do they say of me"?</p>

<p>"Some affirm that thou art as beautiful as the opening
lotus, but others"&mdash;</p>

<p>The girl broke off timidly.</p>

<p>"Others," concluded the Rani with a smile. "Others
are afraid for their sweethearts, aye Rati"?</p>

<p>"Perchance, noble Lady," acquiesced the girl.</p>

<p>The Rani's humor displayed itself in a silvery laugh
that was echoed by the walls of the court.</p>

<p>"Rati," she commanded, "what more do they say"?</p>

<p>"O great one," petitioned the girl, "urge me not in
this manner, lest thou become offended."</p>

<p>"Offended surely will I become unless thou doest as
I bid thee."</p>

<p>The girl paused a moment, then proceeded fearfully.</p>

<p>"They say, O Rani, that thou art vain of thy beauty,
and forgettest thy modesty as a Hindu woman by so
openly consorting with soldiers and gallants."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Say they so," the Rani cried passionately, stung to
the quick by the implication.</p>

<p>The girl fell at the Rani's feet and implored her not to
visit punishment upon an unwilling offender's head.</p>

<p>"Pardon, O Queen. Thou didst force me," she besought
fervently.</p>

<p>"I am not angry with thee, poor girl," the Rani replied
in a softened tone. "But while my actions are
seen by all, to what do many of these <i>zanana</i> beauties
stoop? The shutters of their windows can best tell. I
will show them, these women of such fine sensibilities,
how the Rani, for all her pride, observes a custom too
much falling into disuse among the rich and great. I
have heard that my honored <i>guru</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> cometh to aid me with
advice, that he even now approaches Jhansi. Go, therefore,
order my bearers, so that I may go forth to receive
him with all the respect due his office."</p>

<p>The girl rose, and departed to obey the Rani's behest.</p>

<p>The Rani raised a hand wearily to her forehead.</p>

<p>"So much discussion to appease," she murmured, "so
much jealousy and envy among those who should assist,
rather than thwart the only one who dared to do what
has been accomplished. Love! Ah, only it seems do the
poor and afflicted truly love the Rani. Even Prasad, who
vows by all things sacred that my image beatifies his
sleep, hath ever a favor uppermost in mind."</p>

<p>Presently a state <i>duli</i><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> with curtains to screen the occupant
from view, was carried to the entrance of the
palace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>To the surprise of her servants the Rani came forth
without her <i>burkha</i>, or long mantle, invariably worn by
native ladies of rank to conceal the whole person in
public.</p>

<p>She promptly ordered the curtains of the <i>duli</i> to be
removed.</p>

<p>For a moment her servants hesitated to comply. Never
before did they recollect such an order to have been given.</p>

<p>"What," she cried. "Dost thou not hear my command?
Take those hangings away. I am not a Mohammedan,
but a Hindu Rani in my own right. Of old
time our princesses were not afraid to show their faces
to the people. It is my pleasure that they shall know
well the features of Lachmi Bai."</p>

<p>The curtains were hurriedly removed. The Rani entered
her chair, and surrounded by her servants was
borne in the direction of the city gate, through which it
was expected her <i>guru</i> would enter.</p>

<p>At the head of the procession, the worthy secretary,
Bipin Dat, marched with pompous dignity. Against all
contingencies, he had prudently further armed himself
with a long sword, that trailed in the dust at his side,
and made him an awe inspiring object to the beggars that
chanced in his way.</p>

<p>As the procession passed through the streets, the people
saluted the Rani with terms of affection. Many turned
to catch a glimpse of her face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>"See," they cried. "The Rani of Jhansi fears not
the gaze of our eyes."</p>

<p>It had gone little more than half the distance to the
gate, when it was met by a bullock cart in which rode
an old man of venerable aspect.</p>

<p>The Rani seemed to instantly recognize his features.
She commanded her bearers to halt.</p>

<p>"It is my dear <i>Guru</i>," she cried. "Ah, how glad I
am to see him."</p>

<p>On his part the old man recognized the rich liveries of
the servants as those of his godchild, the Rani. With an
effort he dismounted from his cart and would have prostrated
himself before her, had she not anticipated his
action.</p>

<p>She alighted quickly and knelt at his feet. She embraced
them affectionately, and cried in a voice which all
might hear:</p>

<p>"O <i>Guru</i>, live forever. Grant a blessing to thy godchild,
Lachmi Bai."</p>

<p>For a moment the old man's face reflected the astonishment
of the crowd that had gathered. That she
should thus humble herself in public was certainly a
surprising act. But its significance was not lost upon
the people, who, as the old man raised her in his arms
tenderly, called down a thousand blessings on her
head.</p>

<p>The first greetings over, the <i>Guru</i> was about to again
climb into his rickety vehicle, when the Rani interposed.
She insisted that he take her place in the <i>duli</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>At first, the old man demurred at so great an honor
being accorded him. But the Rani was persistent.</p>

<p>"Before, I have ever met thee, dear <i>Guru</i>," she cried,
"as but a poor captive in Jhansi. Now that I am the
Rani, I desire my people shall see I am not unmindful
of the ancient customs of our race."</p>

<p>Thus she followed on foot behind her <i>Guru's</i> chair, as
the procession returned to the palace.</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII<br />

<i>THE DARBAR</i></h2>


<p>The great hall of the palace presented a splendid,
an imposing spectacle. Its pillars were decorated
with banners and trophies, its walls hung
with rich draperies from the looms of Kashmir
and Sind. At the further end a throne of ivory inlaid with
silver and mother-of-pearl, was placed under a gorgeous
canopy. It stood upon a platform approached by a short
flight of steps, covered with a Benares carpet of black
velvet embroidered with gold thread. The subdued light,
the atmosphere of antiquity, that pervaded the audience
chamber of the Rani of Jhansi, enforced that reverential
feeling, by which the human voice naturally sinks
into a whisper.</p>

<p>As yet the throne was unoccupied.</p>

<p>In the body of the hall were groups of magnificently
attired maharajas, rajas, and military officers, awaiting
the entrance of the Rani. Diamonds blazed in turbans
of many colors, ropes of pearls hung about their necks,
rubies, emeralds, and sapphires, scintillated in barbaric
profusion amid the gold embroidery of their robes of
state.</p>

<p>Amid these dazzling personages, Ahmad Khan, the
humble servant of God, was a conspicuous figure by the
simplicity of his martial uniform. In his new character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
he had evidently curbed his passion for outward display.
In place of jewels he had mounted a green badge in his
turban, as a sign that he was one among the Faithful who
had obeyed the commandment of the Prophet and made
the pilgrimage to the Holy City. Slung from his shoulder
was a plain leather band suspending a sword encased,
also in a plain leather sheath. But the sword was as sharp
as the arm was strong to wield it. He gazed proudly
round upon the throng. Was there any man who cherished
evil in his heart? If so, his enemy was careful to
display no outward sign of animosity.</p>

<p>Indeed, it was the knowledge that this awe inspiring
warrior had openly espoused the Rani's cause, the report
of his descent upon Sadescheo, carried swiftly to the boundaries
of the state, that had brought many wavering
nobles in haste to tender their allegiance at the first <i>Darbar</i>
of the Rani.</p>

<p>Among the last to enter the hall before the hour set
for the council was Prasad Singh. He had undoubtedly
spent much time and thought in arraying his handsome
form to striking advantage. A diamond aigrette rose
from the folds of his turban directly above his forehead.
A collar of emeralds encircled his neck, his long outer
garment was stiff with embroidery, the velvet scabbard
of his sword was encrusted with gems.</p>

<p>Ahmad who seemed to have been watching for Prasad,
at once strode to the Hindu noble's side and greeted him
with every outward mark of friendship.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>He drew Prasad apart and spoke in an undertone to
avoid being overheard.</p>

<p>"This is thy day, O Prasad," he said congratulatingly.
"Thou wilt be reckoned as among the most fortunate
of men. Thou mayest prepare thyself to receive the felicitations
of both those who wish thee well and those who
envy thee."</p>

<p>Prasad returned the Mohammedan's salutation responsively.</p>

<p>"What did the Rani say," he asked, "when thou spoke
to her of me"?</p>

<p>"What could she say," replied Ahmad, in a tone as
if he had advocated the other's cause so well that there
could be but one conclusion drawn. "What could she
say! I swear never did eloquence so flow from my tongue
in any man's behalf, as it did for thee, my Prasad. I
vowed to the Fair One that the appointment thou seekest
should by every right be thine. Upon the Holy Book I
swore that but for thy dash and bravery, even the war
scarred veteran, Ahmad Khan, might have been compelled
to turn his back before the fury of that night of
storm, and the strength of Sadescheo's frowning walls."</p>

<p>Prasad's gratitude manifested itself in a warm tribute
to the other's friendship.</p>

<p>"But," he protested with a slight accent of concern,
"I fear thou mayest have performed thy task too well,
O Ahmad."</p>

<p>"Not I," returned the other. "Fear not that one who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
has trod the pavement of the Afghan court has not learned
to pick his way most warily. Be assured thy desire is
already granted."</p>

<p>A sound of distant music broke upon their ears.</p>

<p>"Hark"! enjoined the Mohammedan in a whisper.
"Hark! The Rani cometh to <i>Darbar</i>."</p>

<p>As the music drew nearer the nobles ranged themselves
on either side of the hall leaving a passage in the center
for the Rani and her attendants to approach the throne.
A profound silence fell upon the brilliant assembly.</p>

<p>Nearer rolled the sound of an inspiriting martial air.
Presently amid a loud clash of cymbals and the beat of
drums, the foremost of the procession swept into the hall.
Fans of peacock feathers waved aloft, emblems of state
were borne before her to whom all eyes were directed.</p>

<p>"The Rani, the Rani," passed in an impressive whisper
from mouth to mouth. In turn, each of the nobles made a
low obeisance.</p>

<p>She walked with a stately, measured pace, a little apart
from the rest of her suite. As she moved along the human
aisle, the earnest expression on her beautiful features
gathered an abstracted look, as if the thunder of the music
crashing upward to the roof, carried her vision beyond
the brilliant spectacle of the moment, to some perspective
scene yet to be unfolded.</p>

<p>For the occasion she had robed herself with great magnificence
after the Mohammedan rather than the Hindu
fashion of ladies of high rank. Her reason was, perhaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that it afforded her a better means of impressing
those to whom a sumptuous display of jewels and fine raiment
formed a considerable part of their existence.</p>

<p>In place of the simple, graceful <i>sari</i>, she wore an outer
garment of scarlet cloth of gold, disclosing beneath, silken
skirts of delicate hues and of such filmy texture that one
might have supposed it was by a miracle the intricate
embroidery of pearls had been stitched upon the material.
Upon her head there rested lightly a cap of scarlet velvet
set with pearls, that contrasted with the dark color of her
gathered tresses. Pearls, lustrous, priceless pearls,
adorned her neck, her ears, even her slippers. Upon her
fingers, diamonds of Golconda served to draw attention
to the symmetry of her hands.</p>

<p>"In the Paradise of the Prophet," murmured Ahmad
as she passed, "could there be found such a one"?</p>

<p>Following in the Rani's train, the worthy secretary,
Bipin Dat, marched with a lofty air, as if he trod upon
the necks of the nobles present. His glance chanced to
rest upon Prasad Singh. An inward tremor caused his
spirit swiftly to descend to earth.</p>

<p>He hastily grasped a talisman that he had purchased
from his friend the astrologer at great cost, and muttered
a prayer.</p>

<p>"May holy Devi protect her servant from the accursed
designs of the evil one."</p>

<p>The Rani approached the throne and seated herself with
quiet dignity. On her right, the aged man, to whom she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
had accorded so great honor on the previous day, took
up his station. Behind her, grouped themselves the personal
retinue of her court.</p>

<p>The music ceased. Amid the silence which ensued,
Ahmad Khan strode forward to the lowest step of the
throne. He <i>salaamed</i> thrice before the Rani, then turned,
and in a loud voice proclaimed her title.</p>

<p>"Behold," he cried. "The Pearl of Jhansi, the noblest
of our Queens. Long live the fair Rani, Lachmi Bai."</p>

<p>The nobles gravely echoed the Mohammedan's salutation.</p>

<p>Then, one by one, they came forward, and were in customary
form presented. They returned after the ceremony
to chairs of state, or to seats upon the rugs spread
on either side of the throne.</p>

<p>For each she found a suitable expression of greeting,
but to Prasad she spoke in a gentler tone, and bade him
take a place of honor at her hand.</p>

<p>"What did I tell thee," whispered Ahmad aside to him.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan had also been similarly favored by
the Rani.</p>

<p>"What did I tell thee, friend. But I do not blame thy
qualms. Lover like, thou canst not see a flower open
until it is in full blossom."</p>

<p>A smile of gratification lit up Prasad's face, clouded
for a moment as the Rani singled out the young Dost Ali,
to stand upon the dais.</p>

<p>The presentations over, the Rani then rose to address
the gathering. She spoke quietly but in her voice there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
was an unmistakable note of authority. It penetrated
clearly to the furthest recesses of the hall.</p>

<p>First, she graciously thanked the nobles for their response
to her summons to the <i>Darbar</i>, and their spontaneous
recognition of her sovereignty. In return she assured
them that her one aim was to promote the welfare of her
state and people, that to everyone should be secured justice
in his person and property.</p>

<p>"I who had suffered so much in that respect," she
cried, "can never be unmindful of the misfortunes of
others."</p>

<p>She then proceeded to confirm the nobles in all their
ancient rights and privileges, and reviewed the situation
as it related to the cause of India as against that of the
Foreigners. The news from Delhi, she regretted to inform
them, was unsatisfactory. Disrupted by internal
dissension, the position of Bahadur Shah was fast becoming
desperate, in the face of the investment of the city
by the Foreigners. It was surely a warning to them in
Jhansi, she declared emphatically, to submerge all personal
animosities in the common object of defending to
the death, the freedom they had regained with so much
difficulty. She had, the Rani further related, dispatched
trustworthy messengers to urge speedy action, on behalf
of the cause, upon the powerful Maharajas, Gækwar of
Baroda, Sindhia of Gwalior, and the great Mohammedan
Nizam of Haidarabad. There was little reason to doubt
that if they could only be persuaded to follow the unmistakable
sympathy of their troops and people, Delhi might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
yet be preserved to the Emperor, and the Foreigners
driven into the sea.</p>

<p>"But, my Lords," she cried, "we, at any rate, must
prepare ourselves to defend the State of Jhansi against
enemies from whatever direction they may come. The
fortresses that have fallen into decay under the dominion
of the Foreigners must be repaired speedily. New cannon
must be cast forthwith and mounted on the walls.
Ammunition and stores of grain above all our likely needs
accumulated, and more troops raised to guard the passes.
With your loyal co-operation, I have no doubt this necessary
condition of affairs may be brought about with little
waste of time."</p>

<p>The Rani paused for a short space; an interval that
was utilized by her hearers in expressing their approval
of her words.</p>

<p>At the commencement of her address they were impressed
by her beauty and dignity; but as she proceeded
amazement at her clear perception of the danger and needs
of their position, gave place to all other feelings. More
than one exclaimed:</p>

<p>"Truly the voice of Lachmi Bai is that of a great
Rani."</p>

<p>With a motion of her hand she regained their attention,
and continued:</p>

<p>"My Lords," she said. "To direct our best efforts
for the end I have explained, there must above all things
be established a firm central government in Jhansi. Not
that I aspire to deprive any noble of his rule within his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
own district, but all authority must emanate from the
throne it is mine by right to occupy. For this purpose
certain officers of government must be appointed."</p>

<p>Ahmad's countenance remained impassive, while Prasad's
gathered a look of eager expectancy.</p>

<p>"It is," the Rani continued, "partly to gain your approval
of such appointments that I have called you to
this <i>Darbar</i>. By such action, I trust, no jealousies will
be aroused, no mistakes made that will stir up internal
discord."</p>

<p>She paused for a moment, but as the countenances of
the nobles thus far indicated approval of her words, she
resumed.</p>

<p>"First, it is my desire that my honored <i>Guru</i> present,
whose advice hath ever been of great benefit to me since
my childhood, shall occupy the office of minister of state.
In choosing him, you all know I am but following many
ancient precedents, whereby <i>Gurus</i> of kings and princes
have, by their wisdom, added luster to the crowns worn
by their godchildren. Have I your approval of the appointment"?</p>

<p>Perhaps for the reason that no one particularly aspired
to the office, perhaps because they might have thought
there was little to be feared in the person of the venerable
form at the Rani's side, the reply came unanimously, that
the Rani's worthy <i>Guru</i> should be appointed her minister
of state.</p>

<p>"It is well, my lords," she cried. "Now to a more difficult
matter. It must be known to you all that an army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
without a chief commander, whose orders must be obeyed
by everyone without question, is a mere rabble in the face
of the enemy. But the difficulty in Jhansi is, that all my
officers are so brave and competent, that to single one out
from amongst the others for the high honor in my gift,
is an impossibility. I have, therefore, to suggest a remedy
in this way."</p>

<p>She moved forward to the edge of the dais and stood
before them, a majestic figure.</p>

<p>"My Lords," she cried, stretching forth an arm. "I,
Lachmi Bai, the Rani, will command the forces of the
State. If anyone doth say me, nay, he hath the right to
let his voice be heard in council. I will listen to him
patiently."</p>

<p>At critical moments in the lives of those destined to
play heroic parts in the eyes of their fellow creatures, it
not infrequently happens, that nature appears to cast a
vote in their favor, by a striking manifestation of sympathetic
accord. To many, such may be no more than
coincidences, but to some, particularly to the Oriental,
they are fraught with deep significance.</p>

<p>The sun mounting over the Palace discovered a rent
in the awning of one of the windows set in the roof of
the <i>Darbar</i> hall. It sent forth a shaft of dazzling light
that, penetrating the darkened chamber, descended full
upon the form of the Rani of Jhansi. In her robes of
state, for the moment, she appeared in a blaze of splendor,
that to her audience betokened a supernatural power
guiding her destiny. Against such, what was man, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
he should dare to raise a voice in protest? Was it not
clearly a sign that the blessing and protection of the great
God rested on her head. Even to Ahmad Khan, surprised
and dumbfounded by the Rani's unexpected action,
as seeming to again baffle his carefully laid plans, the incident
was not lost upon his sense of superstition.
Prasad's mind merely reflected the feelings of the others.
A profound silence followed the Rani's declaration. No
man ventured a yea or nay.</p>

<p>The Rani waited patiently a few moments for their
answer, then again spoke.</p>

<p>"By your silence, my Lords, am I to gather your consent"?
she asked.</p>

<p>A Raja rose from his chair of state and replied:</p>

<p>"Surely thou art the Rani," he exclaimed. "Is it not
the will of God that thy word shall be a law with us.
Thou art the commander of us all."</p>

<p>"It is the will of God," came without a dissenting voice
from all parts of the hall. "Aye, it is the will of
Mahadiva."</p>

<p>The Rani warmly thanked the nobles for their confidence.
She again eulogized their valor and loyalty, assuring
them that when the moment of danger threatened,
she would not be found wanting in courage, if necessary,
to lead her army in person. So gentle yet so stirring was
her appeal, that even the hearts of those before given
over to sensual indulgences, were moved to do brave
actions in her behalf.</p>

<p>They sprang to their feet and shouted enthusiastically.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
"Thou art our Rani. We will follow thee to the death,
O Queen of Jhansi."</p>

<p>An expression of surpassing happiness rested on her
face.</p>

<p>"Then, my Lords," she cried, "I bid you all attend me
to-morrow when I will repair in state to the White Turret,
and raise upon it my banner as the emblem of my
military authority."</p>

<p>"And let him who dares," she concluded, "lift his hand
against it."</p>

<p>The walls trembled with the applause which her concluding
sentence and her defiant air brought forth.</p>

<p>Again she enjoined silence by a gesture.</p>

<p>"Before the <i>Darbar</i> closes," she added, "I have yet to
speak a word to you. With much thought I have decided
that the well tried valor of the noble Ahmad Khan, entitles
him to the subordinate command of the forces
quartered in the cantonments, as long as he shall remain
in Jhansi. Further, for certain reasons, I will appoint as
my lieutenant of Jhansi, the noble, Dost Ali, lately come
to us from the great Amir of Afghanistan, Dost Mohammed."</p>

<p>Briefly she recapitulated the reason urged by Ahmad
Khan for the Dost's appointment to the greater office.
No voice dissenting she then declared the <i>Darbar</i> closed.</p>

<p>Kindly she turned to Prasad and invited him to accompany
her to her private apartments.</p>

<p>With intense chagrin, jealousy, and disappointment in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
his heart, he bowed haughtily, and pleaded as an excuse
a pressing matter requiring his presence elsewhere.</p>

<p>For a moment a look of pain crossed her face.</p>

<p>But the music again sounded, the fans of state waved
on high, the procession re-formed, and between the ranks
of <i>salaaming</i> nobles, the Rani retired from her first
<i>Darbar</i>.</p>

<p>Ahmad Khan had scarce time to adjust his plans to
the unexpected course taken by the Rani. But in the
appointment of his <i>protégé</i>, even to the lesser position of
honor, he beheld a dagger by which to stab his rival's
favor with the Rani, a fatal blow.</p>

<p>Prasad strode toward the door, wrapt in gloomy, bitter
feelings, without exchanging a parting salutation with
anyone.</p>

<p>Ahmad followed quickly and caught up with the Hindu
noble before the latter had crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>"Stay, good friend," he cried. "Thou art in a great
hurry to shake the dust of the <i>Darbar</i> hall from thy feet."</p>

<p>"Aye," returned the other, with sullen ill humor.
"And it will not be long before I shake the dust of the
accursed city from my feet."</p>

<p>"Why so"? asked Ahmad with assumed astonishment.</p>

<p>"Why so," retorted Prasad angrily. "How canst thou
ask, why so, after thy cajolery"?</p>

<p>Ahmad shrugged his shoulders deprecatingly.
"Friend, Prasad," he asserted. "I give thee my word,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
no man in the <i>Darbar</i> was more astonished than Ahmad
Khan when the Rani grasped the sword of state herself."</p>

<p>For once he spoke the truth honestly.</p>

<p>"Of that I make no complaint," retorted Prasad. "If
the Rani so wished it, hers was the prerogative; though
a strange one for a woman to assert."</p>

<p>"Then to what hast thou taken so much offense"?
asked the Mohammedan with apparent innocence.</p>

<p>Prasad, in turn, regarded Ahmad with a look of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Art thou so guileless, O Ahmad Khan"? he asked,
"after all that has passed between us, not to imagine that
I might be offended with the Rani's action, in giving to
another&mdash;a stranger&mdash;that which she knew I besought of
her favor."</p>

<p>"Ah! as to that, my Prasad," returned Ahmad, pacifically,
"there may have been many reasons in the Rani's
mind, apart from the chief one given. She may have assumed
thou wouldst not have cared for the lesser honor
conferred upon Dost Ali&mdash;by the way a handsome fellow
too; or, woman like, mind, I say no word against the
beauty, wisdom, and courage of the Rani, she may have
admired the gallant bearing of this fellow. A new
favorite, perchance. Thou must remember, good Prasad,
she is a woman as well as Rani, and turneth her gaze
first upon one, then toward another."</p>

<p>Prasad's brow scowled threateningly.</p>

<p>"By God," he muttered. "She shall not treat me so."</p>

<p>"Nay, nay, Prasad," Ahmad rejoined restrainingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
"Thou canst not dictate to the Rani. She would care
little even if thou didst menace her with a sword. With
her thou must fence with other weapons. I make no
doubt it is but a passing fancy she hath conceived for this
Dost Ali."</p>

<p>"Dost Ali"! Prasad muttered fiercely, "Dost Ali!
Dost Ali had better look to the sharpening of <i>his</i> sword."</p>

<p>"Come! come, good Prasad," continued Ahmad, laying
a friendly hand upon the other's arm. "Dost Ali
hath no weight in the Lovely One's esteem. But display
thy spirit and she will quickly turn again to thee, for she
loveth thee in her heart, I could swear to it. Be advised
in this way. Absent thyself from the ceremony of to-morrow.
I will tell her I know not what ails thee, that
thou art falling sick, perchance. Then behold how she
will fly to thy side. Then see how speedily she will grant
anything thou askest."</p>

<p>"Ahmad," the other returned gravely. "I know not
what to think of thee. Thy ways here may win for thee
the Seventh Heaven of thy Prophet's Paradise, or the
lowest pit of his Inferno. But thou givest shrewd advice,
I make no doubt."</p>

<p>Ahmad laughed. "Come, friend," he rejoined.
"Clearly thou dost not understand a woman's ways. She
delighteth in men striving for her favor, but let the
chosen one display indifference, and she is at his feet. In
the meantime let us to my house without the city.
There," he added insinuatingly, "thou wilt discover a
little treasure that may amuse thee&mdash;a Kashmir dancing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
girl of no ordinary charm, my Prasad. True her eyes,
her lips, her form, are not comparable to the endowments
of the superb Rani, but she hath a way with her that
pleaseth many. Some of the <i>Giours'</i> spirits have I, too;
and though as one of the Faithful I may not taste of
such, yet thou mayest in their subtle waters, forget the
passing cloud until the sun shall again blaze upon thy
turban. Come! Let us away, and forget our disappointments.
All will yet go well with thee."</p>

<p>To this proposal, after some demur, Prasad reluctantly
consented.</p>

<p>With a courtly bow that concealed the sinister smile
upon his face, Ahmad motioned the Hindu noble to take
precedence of him, by passing first out of the <i>Darbar</i> hall.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>




<h2>Chapter IX<br />

<i>AT THE HOUSE OF AHMAD KHAN</i></h2>


<p>The house of Ahmad Khan, with numerous out-buildings,
was situated in a large compound,
pleasantly shaded by willows, and overlooking
the placid waters of the lake that stretched
over a wide expanse to the eastward of the city. Both
externally and internally its atmosphere suggested the impression
that the owner was not averse to a comfortable,
even a luxurious retreat after the hardships and dangers
of his military exploits.</p>

<p>If the stables filled with high-bred chargers, the walls
decorated with a splendid collection of trophies, and the
large retinue of armed servants unmistakably emphasized
the profession of Ahmad Khan; the shaded halls, luxurious
divans, and the soft rugs woven in rich colored
arabesque patterns, told that he possessed other tastes
than those pertaining to the field of battle.</p>

<p>To Prasad he remarked these evidences of another life
apologetically.</p>

<p>"For Ahmad Khan, O Prasad," he said, "the step of
a mosque, or the bare ground for a sleeping place is
enough; a bowl of rice and a cup of the coffee he has
learned to drink in foreign lands sufficient provender; but
for those who honor his roof with their presence, he is
bound by the law of Islam to provide more generous
entertainment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Truly," returned Prasad, as his eyes wandered over
the handsome furnishings of the house. "Truly if thou
keepest all these things solely for the benefit of thy guests,
thou must indeed be a prince of hospitality."</p>

<p>Ahmad consigned his friend to the care of a skillful
barber, who, for an hour previous to the evening meal,
deftly shaved, perfumed, and assisted in attiring the
Hindu noble's person in garments befitting one to whom
the Lord of the House desired to extend the greatest
honor.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the least semblance of offense to his
guest's susceptibilities, Ahmad had ordered the dishes of
the repast to be prepared separately, those from which
Prasad was to partake being cooked by a Brahman.
For a similar reason water was served by one of that
caste.</p>

<p>The meal was sumptuous, both in the display of gold
and silver plate, and in the long succession of courses
spiced to tempt the palate of an Oriental epicure.</p>

<p>Prasad's ill humor was plainly marked in his meagre
appetite. Savory dishes, of which he would, under ordinary
circumstances, have partaken with avidity, he
barely tasted. Others, he let pass without even inserting
his fingers to test their quality.</p>

<p>"Come," cried Ahmad, at the conclusion of the banquet,
"thou shalt now drink of the choicest of the <i>Giours'</i>
spirits. I warrant that after the first cup thy peace of
mind will be restored. Thou wilt forget past disappointments
in the happiness of the present."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>Wine for Prasad's benefit, and coffee for the Mohammedan
were then served. <i>Hookahs</i> were set before them
and lit by obsequious servants.</p>

<p>Prasad cast restraint to the winds and drank deeply,
while his companion watched him craftily, encouraging
his libations. But the insidious spirits of the Foreigners,
looted from their bungalows, only served to intensify his
dejection.</p>

<p>"Accursed life," he muttered. "What am I, that I
should submit so tamely to the fickle humor of the Rani"?</p>

<p>"Patience, good friend, a little patience," returned
Ahmad assuagingly, yet with an added sting.</p>

<p>"Dost Ali is but a passing fancy. Forget him in the
pleasure of the moment. Drink, and thou wilt surely feel
a new man before the <i>Mollah's</i> voice at sunrise, calls the
Faithful to their devotions."</p>

<p>He raised his hand as a signal to an attendant, a heavy
curtain was drawn back and a group of musicians, accompanied
by dancing girls arrayed in yards upon yards
of silken drapery, entered the apartment. They advanced
to the divan upon which the two nobles sat languidly
drawing from their <i>hookahs</i> and <i>salaamed</i> deferentially.
The musicians then seated themselves in a half circle in
front of the divan, while the girls awaited the first bars
from the instruments. Presently an inspiring air rose in
the chamber, the girls assumed individual poses, and the
<i>natch</i> commenced.</p>

<p>Their graceful actions, glancing steps, and sensuous attitudes,
frequently called forth words of praise from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Mohammedan; but Prasad's gloomy thoughts remained
unconquered.</p>

<p>"Surely thou art hard to please," remarked Ahmad, as
the girls retired for a brief rest.</p>

<p>"Thou knowest the distemper of my mind," replied the
other sullenly.</p>

<p>"Aye, but wait," exclaimed Ahmad. "The jewel that
shall bring fire into thine eyes hath not yet appeared."</p>

<p>He again gave a signal. The curtain was once more
withdrawn. Upon the polished surface of a slab of ebony,
uplifted upon the shoulders of six stalwart <i>harkars</i>,
Ganga, the star of <i>natch</i> girls, was borne into the room.</p>

<p>For a moment, even Prasad's gaze rested approvingly
upon the seductive form of the famous dancer. Her
supple figure, attired in elaborately embroidered shawls,
and colored silken skirts, artistically disclosed, one beneath
another, was displayed with an effect well chosen
to captivate those whom it was her profession to enthrall.
Flowers adorned her hair. Her neck, arms, and ankles
were ornamented with jeweled trinkets.</p>

<p>Upon the <i>harkars</i> halting before the divan, she raised
her arms above her head, and assumed a graceful pose.
In a low, fascinating tone, she commenced a dreamy song
of love. Presently her feet caught the rhythm of the
music, and to the accompaniment of tiny silver bells attached
to the bangles on her wrists and ankles, she portrayed
by her actions, in turn, the passions of love, hope,
jealousy and despair.</p>

<p>From time to time Ahmad uttered exclamations of
satisfaction. Prasad, in spite of himself seemed to be
fascinated by her charm.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 900px;">
<img src="images/i105.jpg" width="900" height="558" alt="" />
<div class="caption">"Didst thou mark that languorous glance she cast on thee"?&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_105">105</a>.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>Ahmad quickly noticed his guest's brightening humor.</p>

<p>"What did I tell thee," he whispered insinuatingly.
"Miserable indeed would be the man whose soul was
insensible to the eyes of such a one. Didst thou mark
that languorous glance she cast on thee"?</p>

<p>Prasad sighed heavily.</p>

<p>"I grant you," he replied, "with but one exception, she
hath a matchless form. At any other time she might
have made a fair impression. Now, chains bind my soul
about a thankless vision."</p>

<p>The girl finished her part by lightly springing from her
elevated position, and prostrating herself before the
nobles.</p>

<p>Ahmad took from his waistband a handful of gold
coins and tossed them to the girl.</p>

<p>"Take them, O Ganga," he cried. "By <i>Allah</i>! Thou
hast almost performed a miracle. Thou hast found favor
in the eye of the inconsolable."</p>

<p>A slight note of sarcasm marked the Mohammedan's
concluding sentence.</p>

<p>Far into the night the two nobles watched the repeated
efforts of the dancing girls, stimulated by cups of wine,
to outdo their previous displays of art. But after the
first surprise on beholding Ganga's charms, Prasad relapsed
within his cloud of dejection.</p>

<p>At last, the early shafts of dawn penetrated the reed
blinds and mingled their light with that of the silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
lamps suspended from the roof; a warning that the
moment of sunrise was at hand. Twittering of awakened
birds, and the voices of men and beasts proclaimed for
the multitude the passing of the hour from rest to labor.</p>

<p>Prasad rose wearily from his recumbent position.</p>

<p>"Ahmad," he exclaimed. "In truth, I feel as if I
may be sick. Perchance thou wilt not be obliged to resort
to subterfuge in my behalf."</p>

<p>Ahmad turned a penetrating look toward his guest.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt not attend the ceremony of to-day"? he
asked.</p>

<p>"As thou advisest," returned the other. "Do what
thou thinkest best for me. I am sick with love, with
jealousy, with I know not what, for yonder Rani."</p>

<p>He turned and slowly made his way toward one of the
exits from the room.</p>

<p>Ahmad also rose to a standing posture.</p>

<p>From the balcony of a minaret near by, the voice of a
<i>Mollah</i> resounded through the clear atmosphere.</p>

<p>"There is but one God and Mohammed is the Prophet
of God."</p>

<p>Ahmad strode from the room to a porch facing the
west. He knelt and reverentially bowed his forehead to
the pavement.</p>

<p>"Thanks be to God," he murmured devoutly, "for the
countenance He turneth toward His servant."</p>

<p>Then he uplifted his face to the brightening heavens.
He stretched forth his arms above his head, as he cried
in a deep, sonorous voice:</p>

<p><i>"Allah! Allah! Allah"!</i></p>

<h2>Chapter X<br />

<i>THE WHITE TURRET</i></h2>


<p>In the open space before the main entrance to the
Rani's palace, a crowd of nobles, soldiers, and
sightseers had collected. High mettled horses led
by grooms, paced back and forth, while their
owners in dazzling groups discussed the news of the
morning. Peddlars of trifles, beggars, and ascetics, plied
their various callings profitably in the interval awaiting
the Rani's departure for the White Turret.</p>

<p>Before the door a suite of officers and servants in gala
liveries, surrounded a royal elephant, gorgeously caparisoned
with plumes, and scarlet velvet cloths embroidered
with gold thread. To its back was strapped a canopied
state <i>houdah</i> for the use of the Rani.</p>

<p>Near by, a groom with difficulty controlled the impatient
spirit of a pure blue-black Arabian charger, the
property of Ahmad Khan. The Mohammedan noble had
entered the palace to make his daily report to the Rani.</p>

<p>Presently, without ceremony, the Rani came forth. A
short period of confusion ensued as the nobles hurriedly
sought their horses, and the soldiers pressed back the
throng surging about the palace.</p>

<p>The Rani paused on the steps and gazed round as if
she missed a familiar object. In so doing her eyes
chanced to rest approvingly upon Ahmad's mount.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Whose brave steed is that"? she asked of an attendant.</p>

<p>Ahmad strode forward and acknowledged himself as
its owner.</p>

<p>"A gift from the Amir of Bukhara," he explained, "in
recognition of a slight military service rendered. I prize
the beast more than all the occupants of my stables together.
No one hath ever crossed his back but myself,
and," he added, "I doubt if anyone would care to try."</p>

<p>"Ah," laughed the Rani. "Dost wager a challenge
then on Akbar's behalf"?</p>

<p>"Not I, fair Rani," returned the Mohammedan, "for
it might mean a speedy death to one so venturesome."</p>

<p>Impulsively the Rani walked toward the beast.
"Akbar," she cried, "Dost recognize a friend with those
clear eyes of thine"?</p>

<p>The animal started, arched its proud neck, and snorted
defiantly.</p>

<p>"Come, good Akbar," exclaimed the Rani soothingly.
"Come. Thou art too noble a beast to display malice to
a woman."</p>

<p>Fearlessly she raised her arm and affectionately stroked
the glossy neck, passing her hand gently downward across
its face.</p>

<p>A tremor passed over the beast's frame. It stamped
the ground and whinnied as if half pleased with the
caress, yet still uncertain in its humor.</p>

<p>Ahmad hurried to the Rani's side, while others watched
with expressions of alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Noble Lady," he urged. "I pray thee touch not the
beast. Its temper is so uncertain that I cannot answer
for your safety."</p>

<p>The Rani again laughed lightly, as she permitted the
animal to sniff her hair, her face, and hands.</p>

<p>"Akbar knoweth whom to trust," she cried. "See,
he discerneth a true Maratha, of whom it has been said,
he is born in the saddle with a sword in his hand. I vow,
O Ahmad," she added, "this day I will ride your Akbar,
or go in no other manner to the White Turret."</p>

<p>Before Ahmad could interpose a further objection, she
had gathered the reins in her hand, placed her foot in the
stirrup, and sprung lightly on to the charger's back.</p>

<p>The horse swerved violently, then halted, with ears
set back and form rigid.</p>

<p>A moment of suspense for those watching followed.</p>

<p>"Come Akbar," urged the Rani firmly, while gently
patting the beast's neck. "Come, thou must curb thy
temper for thou canst not throw a daughter of the Marathas."</p>

<p>The beast pricked up its ears at her voice, and neighed
its subjection.</p>

<p>"Ah, Ahmad," she cried with taunting pleasantry,
"thou must seek another mount. Why not ride in the
<i>howdah</i> of my elephant. How much didst thou wager,
friend"?</p>

<p>"Surely the devil is in the girl," he muttered in astonished
accents. "What will be her next performance"?</p>

<p>A servant approached the Rani deferentially.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"If my Lady Rani," said he, "elects to ride on horseback,
will she let her pleasure be known concerning the
noble elephant"?</p>

<p>"Truly," she replied. "If Ahmad Khan likes not to
go in so much state, let my worthy secretary, Bipin Dat
mount on high. From that exalted perch, he can survey
the heavens and the earth complacently, frown majestically
upon the populace, and imagine that he has at last
become a Maharaja."</p>

<p>The Rani shook the reins and curveted to the front of
her nobles.</p>

<p>Gallantly she led the brilliant cavalcade through the
bazaars and streets to that part of the walls upon which
the White Turret had been specially erected to fly her
banner.</p>

<p>Plaudits saluted her progress on all sides. The people
were accustomed to witness the exercise of greater personal
freedom on the part of the Maratha ladies, to what
is usually accorded women of high rank in other parts
of India, but it was the first time they had beheld a princess
of such beauty and high spirit leading, instead of
being surrounded by the retinue of her court.</p>

<p>With admirable skill she controlled Ahmad's restive
charger, until shortly, as if proud of its lovely burden,
the beast followed obediently the guidance of her hand.
At the bastion of the White Turret she dismounted and
approached the spot where a group of officers awaited
her arrival.</p>

<p>Her banner was already bent to the halliards, and held<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
by a lieutenant so that its silken folds might not be sullied
by contact with the ground. Near by, a soldier stood at
a gun ready to ignite the powder of a first salute as the
flag rose upon its staff.</p>

<p>The nobles grouped themselves about the Rani. An
officer holding the halliards begged to know her command.</p>

<p>For a moment she hesitated. Then as if a sudden impulse
had taken possession of her mind, she took the
ropes from his hand and turned toward the nobles.</p>

<p>"My Lords," she cried. "The Rani will herself raise
her banner on the walls of Jhansi, aye, and defend it,
against whatsoever enemy may come."</p>

<p>Slowly hand upon hand she pulled upon the rope.
Slowly the banner, embroidered with her device, rose
upon the staff. It reached the top and waved proudly in
a gentle breeze against the pale blue morning sky. A
white cloud of smoke for an instant hung over the ditch
below the bastion, as the tongue of the cannon saluted
her military rank. Spontaneously swords flashed in the
bright sunlight: spontaneously a loud chorus rose, mingled
with the repeated roar of the cannon, hailing the fair
defender of a throne.</p>

<p>"Lachmi Bai! Lachmi Bai! Rani of Jhansi," they
cried.</p>

<p>She gazed round with joyful gratitude. A moment
later, the same wistful look that marked her countenance
upon the palace steps, came back into her eyes.</p>

<p>She beckoned Ahmad to her side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Where is the noble Prasad Singh"? she asked. "I
have not seen him since the <i>Darbar</i> of yesterday."</p>

<p>An expression of regret settled upon Ahmad's face.</p>

<p>"Noble Rani," he explained. "Prasad Singh is sick."</p>

<p>His manner and intonation, whether intentional or
otherwise, clearly implied a desire to conceal another reason.</p>

<p>The Rani returned his gaze penetratingly.</p>

<p>"I would speak with thee upon our return to the
palace," she enjoined.</p>

<p>Ahmad bowed his compliance to her wish.</p>

<p>The ceremony was over. The Rani thanked the nobles
for their renewed demonstration of affection. She again
urged them to lose no time in repairing the defenses of
their fortresses, and in the arming and drilling of fresh
troops. She bade them farewell until she would again
summon them to <i>Darbar</i>.</p>

<p>So while the Rani's banner fluttered defiantly from the
peak of the White Turret, the procession retraced its way
to the palace. Upon the Rani's countenance happiness
called forth by the enthusiastic greetings of the people,
was occasionally shaded by a look of disappointment.
Something evidently had been wanting to complete the
gladness of the hour.</p>

<p>On dismounting she summoned Ahmad to follow her
into the interior.</p>

<p>"My Lord," she said, when they were alone, "thy
reply concerning Prasad Singh causeth me to suspect
that something hath gone amiss with him. Hath the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
foolish fellow taken umbrage at some new imaginary
slight"?</p>

<p>Ahmad looked uneasy. He hesitated to reply, as if
under the necessity of exercising prudent dissimulation.</p>

<p>"Thou dost not answer me," resumed the Rani, in a
tone of some impatience. "Tell me, I command thee,
why it was that Prasad Singh did not comply with my
invitation to be present at the ceremony of the morning"?</p>

<p>"Fair Lady," Ahmad replied evasively, "surely the
truth is, that the noble Prasad Singh is sick. I doubt
not he was unable to be present."</p>

<p>"Sick is he," the Rani echoed, "Aye, but thy manner
leadeth me to suspect another cause. I beg thee, good
Ahmad, to tell me the nature of his malady. Is it a
distemper of the mind"?</p>

<p>"Noble Rani," returned Ahmad, "Prasad Singh is
sick. I ask thee to urge me to no further explanation."</p>

<p>"But I will urge thee," retorted the Rani imperiously.
"I will have the whole truth from thee ere thou dost leave
the palace."</p>

<p>Ahmad Khan appeared a victim of deep confusion.</p>

<p>"Most gracious Rani," he besought her, "I trust thou
wilt not visit thy displeasure upon one who is my friend,
my good comrade. Verily do I love Prasad as a brother.
Ill would it seem in me to expose the pardonable follies
of a gallant youth."</p>

<p>"Follies," exclaimed the Rani petulantly. "Speak!
What follies hath Prasad Singh committed"?</p>

<p>Ahmad assumed an apologetic mien.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>"Merely, noble lady," he replied, "the usual overflow
of spirit in one of his high birth. He hath indulged too
freely of the accursed spirits of the Foreigners."</p>

<p>A look of disdain settled on the Rani's face.</p>

<p>"So," she cried. "Like too many others he forgets
the precepts of his caste. This, I did not think of Prasad.
The spirits of the Foreigners! Truly one of the many
curses brought to India in their civilizing wake." She
concluded with intense bitterness in her voice.</p>

<p>"Noble Rani," continued Ahmad. "It was to draw
him from the evil habit that I took him to my house; but
alas! by some means he procured the <i>Giours'</i> intoxicating
drink, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked himself suddenly as if he would draw back
from disclosing a moral precipice yawning beneath
Prasad's life.</p>

<p>"And," caught up the Rani quickly. "And what more,
good Ahmad Khan. What more hast thou to tell of
Prasad"?</p>

<p>"Noble Rani," he petitioned with apparent earnestness.
"I implore thee now to close my mouth."</p>

<p>"Nay, thou shalt open it the wider," she rejoined.
"Speak, tell all thou knowest, I command thee."</p>

<p>"Miserable, faithless friend, that I must appear," he
exclaimed self reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Thou wouldst be a disloyal servant if thou didst not
obey thy Rani," she retorted. "Come! It is the Rani
who commands thee."</p>

<p>He spoke in a tone of regretful emotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou hast heard, noble Rani, of the charms of a certain
<i>natch</i> girl, Ganga, by name"? he asked.</p>

<p>"Aye," she replied tersely.</p>

<p>"Alas! then," continued Ahmad. "The noble Prasad
lyeth sick or drunk, I know not which, of the Giours'
spirits and the subtle influence of this dancer of Kashmir."</p>

<p>For a moment even Ahmad quailed before the display
of jealous anger on the Rani's face. She raised her arm
with a threatening gesture as if about to give full play to
her resentment; but as suddenly as the flame of passion
had been called forth, as quickly it yielded to her control
of temperament.</p>

<p>"Go," she commanded in a quiet voice, made more impressive
by the emotion with difficulty suppressed. "Go,
tell Prasad Singh, the Rani orders his presence hither
immediately. If he delays, he may mount his horse and
ride forth from her state.</p>

<p>"I have spoken," she concluded, turning from the
Mohammedan.</p>

<p>"Noble Lady," petitioned Ahmad, "thou dost not
blame thy servant for disclosing that which his conscience
had enjoined him to conceal. Alas! Prasad hath
eaten of Ahmad's salt."</p>

<p>"Thou hast obeyed my command," she replied. "In
so doing thou didst well."</p>

<p>Ahmad bowed low and left the apartment.</p>

<p>The Rani turned again to watch his retreating form.
When it had disappeared from view, sorrowfully she
unfettered her emotion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! that Prasad&mdash;Prasad, whom as a woman I have
loved, and as the Rani I would honor, should appear in
such a weak, a worthless light. Prasad, my Prasad,"
she cried, "that thou of all men shouldst be the shadow
to darken my hour of happiness."</p>

<p>A sob broke from her lips. She covered her face with
her hands.</p>

<h2>Chapter XI<br />

A SHREWD DIAGNOSIS</h2>


<p>In spite of the Rani's urgent dispatch, Ahmad returned
leisurely to his house. If gravity rested on
his face, his spirit was grimly elated at the successful
progress of his design upon Prasad.</p>

<p>"The accursed Hindu," he muttered at intervals.
"He is well enmeshed in the net God has placed in the
hands of His humble servant."</p>

<p>Prasad expectantly awaited his host's arrival on the
porch. He marked the Mohammedan's serious aspect
and begged of him the reason.</p>

<p>"Hath something gone amiss, good friend"? he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>Ahmad waved his hand indifferently, as he drew
Prasad to a room apart.</p>

<p>"It is nothing that can be defined clearly," he returned,
"but a feeling of uneasiness caused by the Rani's capricious
humor. One knows not what to expect of her next.
At the ceremony of the morning she first insisted upon
riding to the White Turret on my Arabian charger,
Akbar; and then raised her banner with her own hands.
In truth, though," he cried with a note of genuine admiration,
"I cannot but own she made a brave display of
spirit. She looked as gallant a captain as ever rode at
the head of a troop. The people worship her, the nobles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
prostrate themselves at her feet, even Akbar, who never
yet submitted to the caress of any mortal being, acted
like a lover at the sound of her voice, and followed the
guidance of her hand as obediently as a faithful hound.
I confess I know not what to make of her."</p>

<p>"True, O Ahmad," acquiesced Prasad. "Thou hast
in part stated my own sentiment in regard to her. I
know not what to make of the peerless Rani. But tell
me," he urged, "did she notice my absence? Did she
by word or sign indicate her feeling"?</p>

<p>Ahmad replied thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I make no doubt the Rani marked thy absence, O
Prasad, for it seems nothing of any moment escapes her
notice. But as she loveth thee, she is far too circumspect
a woman to disclose her tender sentiment in public.
A favor she may cast here and there, as in the case of this
Dost Ali; but the expression of her deeper feeling she
will keep for thy ear alone. Thou wilt doubtless hear
from her in some covert manner. She will, in turn, up-braid
thee for thy negligence, and lavish upon thee tributes
of her devotion. Have patience, good friend, for it is
no boast that Ahmad Khan hath not mingled in more
than one court intrigue without learning somewhat of the
devious ways of women. Thou must control thy passion
for a little."</p>

<p>"Patience"! exclaimed the other with every sign of
impatience. "How can I have patience when I think she
may, even at this moment, be casting her ravishing smiles
upon Dost Ali."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! Dost Ali," Ahmad returned contemptuously.
"Think not of him. He is but a feather wafted to her
feet to-day, and to-morrow blown by the wind of Fate,
God alone knows whither."</p>

<p>Prasad cast himself wearily upon a divan.</p>

<p>"Ahmad," he exclaimed. "Verily am I sick. I know
not what it is that ails me."</p>

<p>Ahmad regarded his guest with apparent concern.</p>

<p>"Aye," he responded, "thou dost look unwell. Thy
brow is feverish. Thou art out of humor, and hadst
better see a skilful physician who will soon set thee in
order. One such as I have in mind, the worthy doctor
and astrologer, Mohurran Goshi. He hath mastered all
the ancient schools of medicine; a man of profound learning,
a sure foreteller of things about to happen."</p>

<p>"I beg thou wouldst send for him quickly," besought
Prasad, "that he may relieve me of the burden that
seems to be crushing me to earth."</p>

<p>Ahmad readily complied. He summoned an attendant,
by whom he dispatched an urgent call to the
astrologer.</p>

<p>In the meantime he regaled Prasad with the gossip of
the court. He told of the ceremony at the White Turret,
referring insinuatingly to the favor displayed toward
Dost Ali, and of the Rani's varying humor.</p>

<p>As a consequence Prasad's restlessness and jealousy
increased, in spite of the mollifying clause which Ahmad
invariably subjoined.</p>

<p>The jolting of a bullock cart as it rumbled along the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
uneven road leading up to Ahmad's door, told of the
astrologer's arrival.</p>

<p>Ahmad went forth to meet him alone. As soon as the
astrologer had alighted, the Mohammedan engaged him
in a whispered conversation.</p>

<p>"Thou fully understandeth thy part, learned Astrologer,"
he said in conclusion.</p>

<p>"Most rightly, noble Lord," the other answered obsequiously.</p>

<p>"Thy reward shall be greater than even thy mind can
conjure, if thou art successful in ridding Jhansi of this
meddlesome interloper," Ahmad promised. He conducted
the astrologer-physician to Prasad's side.</p>

<p>In a bag slung over one shoulder, Mohurran Goshi
carried his medicinal pills and ointments; while in the
hand of the other arm, he grasped his calendar, and certain
instruments pertaining to the occult branch of his
dual profession. He approached Prasad and felt the patient's
pulse gravely. Gravely, too, he examined Prasad's
tongue, shook his head several times significantly, and
then betook himself to a seat on the floor near by, where
he absorbed his mind in a deep scrutiny of his calendar,
intermittently muttering an unintelligible jargon.</p>

<p>As a result he finally delivered a sage diagnosis of the
case.</p>

<p>"It is clear, noble sir," he said, addressing Prasad,
"that the origin of your malady lies in the evil influence
of an enemy working through the affection of one upon
whom your heart is set, but whose notice he has temporarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
beguiled. Most fortunate is it that you have called
to your assistance, in time, a physician-astrologer, by
profound study and long experience, well fitted to combat
such designs."</p>

<p>Mohurran Goshi glanced craftily toward Ahmad, and
gleaning that thus far his opinion was being well received,
proceeded:</p>

<p>"By a sure sign I can demonstrate to you, great sir,
the truth of what I affirm, that I am able to avert impending
misfortune on your behalf, restore the object of
your affection to your arms, and further you in your ambition.
Soon will your sickness pass away like darkness
before the rising sun. Is it the noble Lord's pleasure
that I should do this"?</p>

<p>Prasad had not escaped the atmosphere of superstition
in which the majority of his race had from time unknown
been reared. In his condition of mind he was more than
ready to fall a victim to the wiles of the astrologer.</p>

<p>"Do so," he replied. "From what you have said I
feel great confidence in your ability."</p>

<p>The astrologer first called for a bowl of water in which
he requested Prasad to wash his hands and forearms.
Then he produced a splinter of bone which he required
his patient to hold in the water, while he muttered in a
low tone for several minutes.</p>

<p>The incantation over, he bade Prasad withdraw his
hand from the water, when there appeared, a little above
the wrist, the blotch of a human form impressed upon
the skin by some dark stain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>The astrologer pointed to the mark on Prasad's arm
with triumph.</p>

<p>"Behold, my Lord," he cried, "the image of thine
enemy, the one who seeks to do thee so much injury."</p>

<p>Both Ahmad and Prasad expressed their astonishment
at what appeared to them a miraculous display of the
astrologer's skill.</p>

<p>"Now, my Lord," resumed Mohurran Goshi. "If it
be thy pleasure that I should foil this enemy of thine,
thou hast but to give thy command."</p>

<p>Prasad well understood the covert allusion to a fee
in advance implied by the astrologer, and produced a
handful of silver coins to secure his valuable services.</p>

<p>These, the astrologer tucked safely away on his person,
and then proceeded to destroy the malign influence aiming
for his patient's ruin.</p>

<p>From Prasad's hand he took the bone, and smeared it
with an ointment, which he declared was composed of
the most precious ingredients&mdash;the fat of a cobra, the
blood of a white rat, salt, and the hoof of an animal
unknown to them. He then rubbed the blotch on
Prasad's arm with the bone for a space, again muttering
unintelligibly, when lo! the image had disappeared.</p>

<p>The astrologer solemnly held up the bone before his
patient's eyes.</p>

<p>"Into this, noble sir, have I gathered the influence
which causes you so much bodily and mental anguish."</p>

<p>With wonder, the eyes of the two nobles gazed upon
the bone fraught with so much magic charm. Though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
as a Mohammedan, Ahmad affected to scoff at the mysterious
science professed by the astrologer, his hereditary
instinct at times caused him momentary qualms, when
inexplicable demonstrations of its power were afforded.</p>

<p>The astrologer next called for a metal tray, a seed,
and a gold coin. These produced, he placed the seed,
the gold coin, and the piece of bone together on the tray,
and once more solemnly muttered incantations over them.
As Ahmad and Prasad watched intently, in a twinkling
the bone leaped into the air and disappeared.</p>

<p>"Thus, my Lord," cried Mohurran Goshi, "will thy
trouble depart from thee, if thou art careful to follow
my directions."</p>

<p>Prasad breathed a deep sigh of relief as if already a
great weight had been lifted from his mind.</p>

<p>The astrologer then took the coin and passed it several
times over his patient's head, muttering incantations as
before, and finally inserted it in a fold of Prasad's
turban. In the process it strangely changed from the
precious metal into copper, another convincing proof of
the astrologer's extraordinary power over inanimate
things.</p>

<p>He then took the seed, and wrapping it in a sheet of
paper bearing cabalistic signs, handed it to Prasad.</p>

<p>"This," said he, "is to place beneath your pillow,
which, with the coin, will surely ward off a return of the
evil influence. Now as to the medicine for your body."</p>

<p>From his bag he drew forth several pills, compounded,
he asserted, of ground pearls, coral, and an herb of wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
medicinal virtue, only found with difficulty in the
high altitudes of the Himalayas. These he enjoined
Prasad to take at certain intervals, setting a price upon
them that might have warranted their curative power
over any ill to which mortal flesh is heir.</p>

<p>"Now," said he, "it will be well for you not to leave
the illustrious Ahmad Khan's roof for some days, during
which I will call to mark your progress, but," he added
insinuatingly, "if through the medium of a discreet
friend, the object of your affection could be brought to
your side, there is no doubt you would attain a speedy
recovery. A slight cloud is still suspended over your
head, but with my aid, be assured, it will be dispelled at
the fitting moment."</p>

<p>Mohurran Goshi then gave some directions regarding
the patient's food, gathered his effects together, consigned
the two nobles to the protection of God, <i>salaamed</i>
several times before them, and went forth to climb into
his rickety bullock cart.</p>

<p>"A sage and skilful physician," remarked Ahmad
approvingly.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly," coincided Prasad. "Now that he hath
assured me that the accursed Dost Ali will be removed
from my path, I feel a change for the better."</p>

<p>"Did I not assure thee that with patience all would
come well," rejoined Ahmad.</p>

<p>"Aye, truly, good friend; but didst thou remark the
last advice of the learned physician"? asked Prasad.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Regarding the mission of a discreet friend"? queried
Ahmad in return.</p>

<p>"To be sure."</p>

<p>"That is an easy matter," exclaimed Ahmad reassuringly.
"To-morrow when I make my report to the Rani
I can prudently disclose to her thy unhappy condition.
No one, good Prasad, can for a purpose assume a more
sympathetic tone of voice, or a more pleading expression,
than thy friend the man of arms. In a moment, I warrant,
the fair Rani will be at thy side."</p>

<p>"Do this for me," returned Prasad in a grateful voice,
"and there is nothing thou canst not ask of me."</p>

<p>Ahmad vowed solemnly that it would be his chief duty
on the morrow.</p>

<p>"And now," said he. "If thou art ordered a meagre
diet, the learned astrologer-physician said nothing against
a bountiful feast for the eyes. Let us see what the fair
Ganga can do to assist us in passing a leisure hour."</p>

<p>"As thou wilt," returned Prasad, evincing but little interest
in his host's suggestion. "Ganga is well enough
doubtless for one whose soul is not captivated by an incomparable
form."</p>

<p>Ahmad glanced with the suggestion of a smile toward
his guest.</p>

<p>"The swine," he muttered underneath his breath.</p>

<h2>Chapter XII<br />

AHMAD AGAIN NONPLUSSED</h2>


<p>In the furtherance of his design, Ahmad anticipated
what might be termed a scene when he made his
report to the Rani upon the following morning.
He fully expected, from his observation of the
character of women in general, that he would find her enraged
and vindictive with Prasad, as the result of the
Hindu noble's failure to respond promptly to her summons.
In this respect he was again destined to experience
a surprise, if not a disappointment.</p>

<p>She received him sedately as became the nature of the
business to be transacted, and without a reference to the
event which had caused her to display so much feeling
on the day before. If Prasad's image still occupied a
place in her mind, no mention of his name came from
her lips to mark her sentiment toward him. Had her
heart been entirely free from the tender passion, she
could not have appeared more composed, more secure in
all that related to her nature as a woman.</p>

<p>From time to time Ahmad gazed upon her with wonder.
In order to draw forth from her an outburst of the fire
of resentment which he was convinced burned inwardly,
he more than once skillfully turned the conversation in
the direction of her truant lover; but the Rani as skillfully
declined his lead, passing on naturally to matters
of public importance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>She absolutely refused to disclose, from the beginning
to the end of the interview, what her thoughts
or intentions were in regard to the Mohammedan's
rival.</p>

<p>As he was about to leave her presence, Ahmad paused
on the threshold with the hope that she would yet make
some reference to Prasad.</p>

<p>The Rani glanced toward him interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Hast thou more to say, O Ahmad"? she asked
calmly.</p>

<p>"Nothing, nothing, great Lady," he answered falteringly,
as he saluted.</p>

<p>She returned the salute with dignity.</p>

<p>"Then I wish thee good fortune until the morrow,"
she concluded.</p>

<p>He left the palace with uneasy speculations rising in his
mind. Treacherous to the core of his nature himself,
the Rani's reserve of manner, caused him to suspect that
treachery was lurking somewhere among his own following.</p>

<p>Could that rascal of an astrologer be playing a double
part? was the first thought that flashed into Ahmad's
brain; or could Prasad be acting in the Rani's confidence
as a spy upon his actions? If the latter happened to be
the case, he reasoned that the Hindu noble must possess
a power of deception of which he had certainly not displayed
the least symptom as yet. Ahmad decided that this
was unlikely. If, then, the astrologer was in reality conspiring
against him, for greater pay on the part of someone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
else, a possible enough contingency, it could easily be
detected. In any case he perceived the necessity of bringing
Prasad's complete ruin in the Rani's estimation to a
speedy issue, or a chance disclosure of his intrigue might
engulf him hopelessly in the ditch, he had so well excavated
for his rival.</p>

<p>He set spurs to his horse and rode quickly to the astrologer's
house.</p>

<p>A prolonged conversation with Mohurran Goshi apparently
satisfied Ahmad that he had nothing to fear from
the duplicity of that crafty personage. He handed the
astrologer a well filled purse as the best tonic to stimulate
his continued fidelity.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt call, then, to see thy patient later in the
day, learned Astrologer," Ahmad remarked, as he prepared
to turn his face homeward.</p>

<p>"At thy command, noble Lord," acquiesced the astrologer
submissively.</p>

<p>"It is well," exclaimed Ahmad. "I warrant thou wilt
find him in an excellent humor for thy purpose."</p>

<p>Ahmad tested the speed of his horse until he approached
within a short distance of the compound surrounding his
dwelling. Then he slackened his pace and assumed an
air of grave dejection.</p>

<p>"Good Prasad must believe that the heart of Ahmad
Khan goes out to him in sympathy," he soliloquized,
"while the disclosure of the Rani's faithlessness is drawn
forth unwillingly from his friendly lips."</p>

<p>Prasad awaited the Mohammedan's return in a state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
of feverish anxiety. He remarked Ahmad's gloomy visage
immediately.</p>

<p>"Thou art the bearer of ill news, O Ahmad," he exclaimed,
ere the usual greetings had been exchanged.</p>

<p>"Alas"! returned the other. "My countenance doubtless
reflects the sadness of my heart."</p>

<p>"Speak," enjoined Prasad. "Tell me the worst thou
knowest, for I feel assured it hath to deal with my
unlucky case."</p>

<p>"The worst may be told quickly enough, good friend,"
replied Ahmad. "Yet, I would that thou urgest me not
to such an unpleasant office. Let us discuss other matters,
and leave the disagreeable topic to a later hour."</p>

<p>Prasad waved his hand impatiently.</p>

<p>"Tell me quickly," he cried. "Bad news is like decaying
fruit. It becomes the more rotten with the keeping.
Did the Rani refuse to hearken to my request"?</p>

<p>"Aye, she did even more than that," came the reply.
"She refused to have thy name mentioned in her presence."</p>

<p>"So"! ejaculated Prasad. "What else hast thou to
tell, my emissary"?</p>

<p>"Why, good Prasad, as I hold thy interest at heart
it pains me deeply to speak thus, but it doth seem the
Rani hath cast herself body and soul into the arms of
this new favorite, Dost Ali. Her actions have become the
scandal of the court."</p>

<p>Prasad raised himself upon his elbow. His brow contracted
and his eyes flashed threateningly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me more," he hoarsely muttered.</p>

<p>"In truth, there is little more to tell," rejoined Ahmad,
"except, that she rides, walks, and feasts with him, and,
the court gossip saith, yields somewhat more besides.
As for me, my business over, she excused my presence
speedily. I would have kept this from thee, but rumor
would surely have broken through my desire."</p>

<p>Prasad rose and paced back and forth in ominous silence.
Suddenly he turned and spoke vehemently.</p>

<p>"Ahmad, sick or well, I vow I will not be supplanted
by this Dost Ali. Immediately will I go to the palace.
Toward the Rani I mean no harm, but with her lover, I
will find an excuse to bring this matter to an end between
us. Either Prasad Singh or Dost Ali shall fall
into the dust."</p>

<p>Ahmad laid a restraining hand upon the Hindu noble's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Prasad," he enjoined, "thou canst not do this."</p>

<p>"Why should I not"? the other asked tersely.</p>

<p>"Because there must be no strife within the Rani's
palace. It would be an act against her pleasure, her
authority. Deeply do I sympathize with thee, O Prasad,
but I cannot countenance thy project."</p>

<p>Prasad returned his host's gaze with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Then, in heaven's name, what wouldst thou have me
do"? he demanded. "Lie here like some decrepit hunter
while another goes off with the quarry. Not I forsooth"!</p>

<p>"Come, good friend, curb thy ambition, passion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
impetuosity for a season. Await with patience the fitting
opportunity for achieving all, without resort to violent
means, that would implacably offend the Rani. Thou,
must remember her palace is not a camp, a field of
arms."</p>

<p>"Oh"! exclaimed Prasad sarcastically. "These are
indeed strange words from Ahmad Khan. Is it so long
ago that he and his followers swept into her palace little
heeding her authority. Truly that scene resembled an
assault."</p>

<p>Ahmad winced at the retort but managed to preserve
his equanimity. He replied in a contrite tone.</p>

<p>"It is even as thou sayest, but the hour was full of
tumult. If my action seemed wanting in respect for the
Rani's dignity, surely I have made the amends I swore
upon the holy book."</p>

<p>Prasad laughed cynically.</p>

<p>"Loyal Ahmad," he cried. "I see not very well how
thou canst prevent me settling with this Dost Ali."</p>

<p>"What I will prevent," the Mohammedan answered,
as if conscious of a virtuous motive, "is the hasty action
of a friend leading him on to certain ruin, aye, even if
I surround the house with soldiers and hold him as a
prisoner. Prasad, the Rani in her present temper would
never forgive thee. Thou must, nay thou shalt have
patience, for thine own interest. Even if thou dost curse
thy friend now, he knows thou wilt presently call down
blessings on his head."</p>

<p>The two regarded each other fixedly. On Ahmad's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
face, entreaty that gave place to determination. Prasad's
countenance, a display of conflicting emotions.</p>

<p>"Come," resumed Ahmad soothingly. "Subdue thy
resentment. I tell thee thy trouble will pass over, and
thou wilt find thyself high in favor with the Rani. In
the meantime enjoy thy enforced absence from her court
as becomes a noble of high spirit. Drink of the Foreigner's
spirits, and," he added in a lower tone, "if
thou wilt, of the charms of the fair Ganga. There are
hundreds who would envy thy present opportunity."</p>

<p>"A curse upon all this mischief," Prasad returned impatiently.</p>

<p>"Hath not the learned astrologer told thee all will
come well"? asked the Mohammedan reassuringly.</p>

<p>"A curse upon him, too," added Prasad. "If he observed
a little more carefully events passing on the earth
instead of keeping his gaze fixed upon the heavens, he
would be able to prophesy more surely. The fool! Were
I the Raja of Jhansi, I would soon find a means to make
him lament his fate, for having disclosed such a budget
of nonsense."</p>

<p>"Thou knowest that as a follower of the only true
Prophet," replied Ahmad. "I set little store upon his
trade as an astrologer; but as a physician, he hath a
reputation whereby he is sought by the greatest nobles
and princes."</p>

<p>"I care not for him or his reputation," returned Prasad
sullenly. "To me, it seems, as if all men, aye and all
women, are leagued against me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is because thou art sick. Wait a day or two
and thou wilt see things more reasonably. Because for
the moment the flower thou longest to possess lies a
little beyond thy reach, content thyself with others that
are near to hand. Now I go to the cantonments to inspect
the troops. When I return we will together
discuss a means of getting rid of this Dost Ali without
offending against the susceptibilities of the Rani; for
in that, upon the oath that I have made, I can take no
part."</p>

<p>With a further profession of his unalterable friendship,
Ahmad departed to his military duties.</p>

<p>He had gone but an hour or so, a period consumed
by Prasad in bitter reflections and vows of revenge upon
his supposed rival, when the bullock cart of the astrologer
again rumbled and creaked its slow progress to the Mohammedan's
door.</p>

<p>Prasad received him in illhumored silence.</p>

<p>The astrologer-physician nevertheless methodically
proceeded to unpack his bag, and to an examination of
his patient.</p>

<p>As before, he gravely felt Prasad's pulse, observed his
tongue, and then expressed himself as being highly satisfied
with the sick man's improved condition.</p>

<p>"I had purposed advising thee to take a bath of oil,"
said he, "but I find it will be unnecessary."</p>

<p>"Truly thou art a wise physician," remarked Prasad
sarcastically. "Tell me now, I beg, how the heavens
look this evening for the attainment of my wishes"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The astrologer scrutinized his calendar for a space, then
replied in a satisfied tone.</p>

<p>"All goes well, noble sir. The moment of triumph
over thine enemy draws nigh. She whom thou lovest
will fly to thy arms speedily."</p>

<p>"Now of all the nonsense uttered by man, thou art
talking the uttermost," replied Prasad in angry accents.
"Dost know, learned Astrologer, that only this morning,
after all that gibberish of thine yesterday, I heard the
worst news possible"?</p>

<p>The astrologer instead of displaying offense at such
a disparaging summary of his ability, appeared to expect
the news.</p>

<p>"Noble sir," he argued in response. "That is as I
anticipated. It often happens that a clearing sky is preceded
by a thunderstorm. If thou wilt but hold thy
patience for two days, then the moment for a determined
action will have come."</p>

<p>"How do you mean"? asked Prasad doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Noble Lord," continued the astrologer in a confidential
manner. "First I must have thy assurance that
thou wilt not disclose a word of what I am about to
unfold to thy illustrious host, Ahmad Khan.</p>

<p>"In truth he is thy friend, but in the enterprise which
it will be well for thee to undertake, he will render thee
no assistance, on account of a certain oath he has taken."</p>

<p>Prasad appeared to resume an interest in the astrologer's
words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Proceed quickly," he urged. "Thou hast my promise."</p>

<p>"Then great sir," continued the astrologer. "Be
pleased to know, that the fair one with whom thou art
enamored, lies under the influence of one from whom she
would gladly be delivered. If thou wert to repair to her
side accompanied by a few trustworthy followers, at a
favorable hour, she would hail thy appearance with joy,
and thou couldst subdue thine enemy with ease."</p>

<p>"Come, learned Astrologer," interposed Prasad, his
humor brightening perceptibly. "Now I realize thou art
a man of action, and consequently a man of sense. Speak
more plainly how thou wouldst advise. Be assured thou
wilt be rewarded relatively with my success."</p>

<p>"Little further is there to say, noble Singh," returned
the astrologer "except that the signs in the heavens declare
midnight two days from hence to be the auspicious
moment."</p>

<p>Prasad thought deeply for some minutes. At last he
again spoke:</p>

<p>"Secluded here as I am, sage Doctor, it would be
difficult for me to arrange the plan of action. I would
that you suggest one for me."</p>

<p>The astrologer glanced round suspiciously as if to note
that they were not overheard.</p>

<p>"That is an easy matter, noble Lord," he replied. "If
thou wilt keep in mind my injunction not to breathe a
word of it to Ahmad Khan, and repair to the tomb of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Firoz Khan, nigh the temple of Siva, overlooking the
lake at one hour before midnight, I will arrange to have
two or three good fellows to meet thee there. A greater
number would arouse suspicion at the gate, but for thy
purpose they will be sufficient. The palace will be asleep,
and thine enemy taken off his guard."</p>

<p>"Thou seemest to know well the secrets of this affair,
learned Astrologer," remarked Prasad.</p>

<p>"Such is my profession, noble sir," replied Mohurran
Goshi, with a note of pride in his voice.</p>

<p>Prasad again buried himself in thought before he spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, learned Doctor," he rejoined finally. "If thou
art sure thou canst aid me in the way suggested, I have
more than made up my mind to follow thy counsel."</p>

<p>A momentary flicker of satisfaction crossed the astrologer's
crafty face.</p>

<p>"As certain, noble sir," he replied emphatically, "as
that the sand in the hour glass of thine enemy's fortune
hath all but emptied itself into the lower vessel."</p>

<p>"Then I will be there," decided Prasad, "at the appointed
place and hour."</p>

<p>"Good, noble Lord," exclaimed the astrologer. "Be
assured I, too, will keep my part of the agreement. Hast
thou taken the medicinal pills regularly"? he asked with
professional concern.</p>

<p>"To the devil with all pills and ointments," retorted
Prasad. "My stomach yearns for other diet."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, sir," enjoined the astrologer in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
character of physician. "They possess among other virtues
that of stimulating the heart with courage."</p>

<p>"I want no such stimulants," retorted Prasad. "An
enchanting form ever present in my mind is stimulant
enough for any act requiring courage. If they would
only assist me in controlling my impatience for the hour
to come, then I might regard them as of some benefit."</p>

<p>"That they will also do, noble sir," asserted the astrologer.
"Their extraordinary value lies in the fact
that they are beneficial for any bodily or mental ailment."</p>

<p>"Then they must be as remarkable in virtue as they
are in price," returned Prasad tersely.</p>

<p>He took a jewel from his turban and handed it to the
astrologer.</p>

<p>"This," said he, "is but a small portion of the reward
I will bestow upon thee, if thy plan turns out as
well as it promises."</p>

<p>The astrologer expressed his gratitude in effusive
terms.</p>

<p>"But be careful that not even the walls shall hear of
it"? he enjoined.</p>

<p>"Fear not," replied Prasad. "At an hour before midnight
I will be at the tomb of Firoz Khan on the day
after to-morrow. See to it that the men are awaiting
me."</p>

<p>"Without fail, noble sir," reasserted the astrologer.</p>

<p>He solemnly called down a thousand benedictions upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Prasad's head, <i>salaamed</i>, and with an air of profound
mystery, retired to seek his bullock cart.</p>

<p>"Now," ejaculated Prasad triumphantly. "We will
see how this Dost Ali can be brought to an accounting
in spite of Ahmad's qualms of conscience."</p>

<p>He called for a goblet of the Foreigners' wine, and
drank with evident appreciation of its quality.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIII<br />

<i>WHAT BIPIN OVERHEARD</i></h2>


<p>Bipin Dat was returning from his morning
prayers at the temple of Vishnu absorbed in
thought. His brow was puckered, his eyes directed
toward the ground, as he made his way
slowly through the press in the bazaar. In his mind serious
doubt had arisen regarding the power of the good tempered
God of the great middle caste to avert the calamity
which the astrologer persistently reasserted was suspended
over his head. Manifestly, it was useless, he reasoned,
to continue his offerings at the shrine of a deity, who
either could or would not protect him, when the face of
some other of the innumerable personages of the Hindu
pantheon was turned with vindictive anger upon his
career. The difficulty was to discover the God to be
propitiated, as by an unlucky chance he might overlook
the very one causing him so much unhappiness. Truly
it was a perplexing situation for the worthy secretary.
He almost wished he were a Mohammedan with only one
God from which to choose.</p>

<p>With unbounded pride ever directing his vision to
impossible heights, he had come to believe that eventually
he might forsake the God of his birth and assume the
right to pay tribute to Siva the mystical God of the Brahmans;
but clearly this was not the hour for the worship
of a deity enveloped in an abstract philosophy. A man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
with his ears and nose, if not his life, in momentary
danger is inclined to resort to a more tangible incarnation
of divine power, and possibly wrath. With terror
enthroned in his soul, what more human than that he
should turn to Siva in that deity's non-Aryan form, as the
awe inspiring God of the mass of the people, or his wife
the bloody fury, the serpent crowned Kali. On the morrow
he determined to prostrate himself covertly in the
temple of the third person of the great Hindu Triad,
and see if a better result might not be obtained. He
heartily wished he was within reasonable distance of a
shrine of holy Mother Ganges, for assuredly immersion
in the waters of the sacred river, could not fail to appease
all the Gods, by this one supreme act of devotion.</p>

<p>So deeply absorbed was Bipin in this all important
problem, that he had failed to more than casually notice
the actions of a small boy with well fattened limbs, displayed
to somewhat unnecessary advantage by a string
tied round his waist with a charm attached as his sole
approach to clothing.</p>

<p>At every few steps taken by the secretary, the small
boy ran forward and interposing his chubby form, salaamed
respectfully.</p>

<p>Several times Bipin had stepped to one side under the
impression that the boy's intention was merely to show
respect for one of such exalted station, but at last becoming
conscious of the youngster's persistency, Bipin
halted and frowned down upon him threateningly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>"How now, boy"? he asked sternly. "What do you
mean by continually getting in my way"?</p>

<p>"Great Secretary Sahib," replied the boy. "I am the
son of Mohurran Goshi."</p>

<p>"<i>Wah</i>"! exclaimed Bipin. "So you are the son of
Mohurran Goshi. Well! what does the son of Mohurran
Goshi mean by repeatedly making of himself a stumbling
block for my feet"?</p>

<p>"Lord Protector of the Poor," replied the boy deferentially.
"My father bade me seek thee urgently with
the message that thou art to repair to his house, without
fail, two hours after sunset."</p>

<p>"Thy father bade thee tell me that I am to come to
his house two hours after sunset," repeated Bipin reflectively.
"Did he say for what purpose, dutiful son
of Mohurran Goshi"?</p>

<p>"Not he, great sir," replied the boy, <i>salaaming</i>.</p>

<p>Bipin thought for a moment. It was possible that the
astrologer had discovered a charm that would forever
confound the machinations of the accursed Hindu noble.</p>

<p>"What answer shall I take from the great Secretary
Raja"? asked the boy with a twinkle of innate cunning.</p>

<p>Bipin gazed approvingly on the lad who flattered his
vanity by the use of such high sounding titles.</p>

<p>"Thou art a well favored youth," he remarked, "and
properly trained in the respect due to people of importance.
Go, tell thy learned father, that I will be at his
door at the hour appointed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>As Bipin took a step forward the boy again interposed
his person with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>"A present, Secretary Raja," he cried. "A present."</p>

<p>"Ah, a present," returned the secretary. "What now
do you want with a present"?</p>

<p>"To buy sweetmeats, noble Lord," the boy answered.</p>

<p>Bipin discovered a small coin in his waistband, and
gave it to the astrologer's son.</p>

<p>The boy <i>salaamed</i> his thanks, and danced off to a
nearby stall, making a sly grimace at the vanishing back
of the Rani's worthy secretary.</p>

<p>A little before the time set by the astrologer, Bipin
urged a matter of importance as an excuse for his absence
from the palace, and directed his steps toward
Mohurran Goshi's humble abode.</p>

<p>He found the astrologer in a state of suppressed excitement.</p>

<p>"There is not a moment to lose, worthy Secretary,"
said he. "Shortly thou wilt be in possession of information
that will enable thee to frustrate thine enemy
for all time. With it, thou canst repair to the Rani and
ask any reward at her hands. But be careful not to disclose
the source of thy information, or thou wilt surely
fail in thy object. Come, follow quickly, and hold thy
peace at whatever thou mayest see or hear, or our lives
would go out as a torch flung into a pond."</p>

<p>Mohurran Goshi rapidly led the Rani's secretary by
dark, narrow alleys, to one of the gates of the city, and
thence out a short distance along a by-path to a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
hut secluded amid a clump of trees. The absence of a
light and the usual yelping of mongrel dogs, suggested
the inference that the place was, at least, temporarily uninhabited.
Mohurran Goshi again enjoined the strictest
silence upon Bipin and bade him remain in the shadow
of an out-building, while he went forward apparently to
reconnoiter. Bipin watched his guide approach the door
cautiously and listen. In a few minutes the astrologer
returned stealthily, and beckoned Bipin to follow. He
led Bipin round to the rear of the house and halted beside
an open window. From within two voices could be heard
in conversation, for the greater part in an unintelligible
undertone, but at intervals rising so that they could be
plainly overheard.</p>

<p>"Dost make out who it is that is speaking"? the
astrologer asked in a whisper.</p>

<p>"One voice rises familiarly on my ears," returned the
secretary.</p>

<p>"Hush"! enjoined the astrologer. "It is that of
thine enemy, Prasad Singh. Wait patiently and listen."</p>

<p>Bipin shivered. A groan of terror was only suppressed
by the greater fear of being discovered.</p>

<p>Presently the voice unknown to Bipin asked a question,
distinctly heard without.</p>

<p>"Dost think, my Lord, that sixty men will suffice for
the affair"?</p>

<p>"They will be enough," returned that of the other
speaker, which Bipin believed to come from the mouth
of Prasad. "We will carry the palace by assault, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
make away with everyone who intercepts our progress,
until we reach the person of the Rani."</p>

<p>"To-morrow night thou hast determined on the attempt"?</p>

<p>"To-morrow night. Be careful to come to the place
of meeting at the tomb of Firoz Khan near the lake, one
hour before midnight."</p>

<p>"As thou commandest. Hast thou a particular desire
to make a prisoner of anyone"?</p>

<p>"Aye truly have I," came the quick rejoinder. "Thou
wilt secure but deal gently with that arch rascal, Bipin
Dat."</p>

<p>Without, the astrologer clapped a hand over the secretary's
mouth to prevent a wail of despair going forth upon
the night.</p>

<p>"Set thy knees and teeth, worthy Secretary," whispered
the astrologer, "or they will shake the heavens
down upon our heads."</p>

<p>"Be very careful of him," continued the voice within,
"as I have somewhat to say regarding his impertinence
and presumption before cutting his nose and ears off,
and flinging his liver to the dogs. Of all those about the
Rani, him I detest the most."</p>

<p>Bipin sank an invertebrate bundle of humanity to the
ground. He entwined his arms about the astrologer's
legs in a mute appeal for protection. His throat was
incapable of uttering a sound.</p>

<p>The astrologer stooped down and shook Bipin by the
shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go," he urged in an imperative whisper, "if thou
wouldst save thy life and that of others. Come, get
upon thy feet. Fly to the Rani's presence, and disclose to
her this accursed plot. Remember that the meeting place
is the tomb of Firoz Khan at one hour before midnight,
to-morrow. I would come with thee but my bones are
old, and must remain to screen thy flight."</p>

<p>Bipin crawled on his hands and knees to a little distance,
and then rising, ran as fast as his corpulency would
permit, back in the direction of the city.</p>

<p>Of that journey he retained afterwards little recollection.
More than once he fell over some obstacle in his
path, to rise with bruised limbs and resume his terror-hounded
course. He lost his slippers in a ditch, and his
turban in a thicket, into which he had strayed in the
darkness. Whether he entered the city by a gate or
scaled the walls he knew not, but panting, scratched, and
with disordered garments, the worthy secretary did at
last reach the palace, and struggle in by the astonished
servants.</p>

<p>At the hour of Bipin's return, the Rani was entertaining
her court with a <i>natch</i> in one of the gardens.
Among others, Ahmad Khan had availed himself of an
invitation to be present, leaving his guest, Prasad, in a
better humor than he had displayed for some days past.
As a sign of reviving spirit, he had even promised the
Mohammedan to take part in a boar hunt on the following
morning. He had scarcely mentioned the Rani's name
since the astrologer's visit of the day before, except to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
remark that he believed Mohurran Goshi's pills and
charms were assisting him to control his passion.</p>

<p>By the light of torches the girls had delighted their
audience with several exhibitions of their art. In an interval
refreshments of sweetmeats and sherbet were being
served, when the strange figure made by Bipin Dat broke
through the half circle formed by the girls and musicians.
Out of breath, with his dress in the utmost disorder, he
waddled to the Rani's position, and with a groan sank
down at her feet.</p>

<p>"Why, what is the meaning of this"? asked the Rani
in accents of surprise. "Truly, O Bipin, thou must
have been chased by the terrible white fox of which thou
livest in such dread."</p>

<p>"O great Lady," moaned Bipin, casting his hands upward
despairingly. "Alas! we are all, every one of us,
now dead."</p>

<p>"Dead"! exclaimed the Rani. "Not quite dead yet,
I think, good Secretary."</p>

<p>"<i>Ah, hae, hae</i>"! Bipin continued to moan piteously.
"Dead, all dead," he groaned; "or before another moon
has set, most assuredly we all will be."</p>

<p>"Now what dost thou mean by this nonsense"? demanded
the Rani impatiently. "Speak, what has reduced
thee to such a condition of distress. Thou art interrupting
the pleasure of my guests."</p>

<p>A groan as if drawn from the pit of his stomach came
forth from Bipin's lips.</p>

<p>"O Rani," he spoke hoarsely. "The accursed Prasad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Singh, may God send his soul into the body of a scorpion
for ten thousand years, he&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At the mention of the Hindu noble's name, the Rani
started and gazed inquiringly upon Bipin, who hesitated,
as if he knew not how to commence his horrifying disclosure.</p>

<p>"Well," urged the Rani. "Well, what of the noble
Prasad Singh. What knowest thou of him"?</p>

<p>"Oh! great Rani. He&mdash;the accursed Prasad Singh
plotteth&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Stay," interposed the Rani quickly. "Stay Bipin, I
will hear what thou hast to impart privately."</p>

<p>"Ahmad Khan," she said, turning to the Mohammedan.
"As Prasad is thy guest, thou wilt come with us
apart. Let the <i>natch</i> continue," she added to an attendant.
"We will return presently."</p>

<p>She led the way to a corridor at one end of the garden
and then addressed Bipin.</p>

<p>"Speak now what thou knowest of the noble Prasad
Singh, and be certain that it is no idle tale, no unfounded
gossip, or rest assured thou wilt suffer real pain without
any doubt."</p>

<p>"Great Rani," returned Bipin plaintively. "Let my
mouth be filled with dust, and my face shaved only on
one side as an object of ridicule for all liars, if I do not
speak the truth. From a wise man, for sometime have I
been warned that Prasad Singh had evil designs upon
my nose and ears. That&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The Rani interposed with angry impatience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thy nose and ears, fool! What would the noble
Prasad Singh care for anything that pertaineth to thy
life or person. Did I not warn thee not to trespass upon
my good nature with such nonsense"?</p>

<p>Bipin assumed an expression of wounded dignity, but
replied with submission.</p>

<p>"Noble Rani, that is as may be; but the same wise
man to make plain to me Prasad Singh's accursed designs
led me this evening to a meeting place, where, in seclusion,
I heard Prasad discuss a plot to assault the palace
to-morrow night. With six hundred, nay I believe it was
six thousand followers, he will put everyone to the sword,
seize your Highness's throne for himself, and, O great
Lady, consign you for evermore to a fortress guarded
by terrible monsters. And as for me, O noble one, alas"!
Bipin whined in terror. "In revenge for my fidelity to
thee, my nose and ears are to be cut off and nailed to the
palace gate, and my body," he groaned deeply, "O holy
Kali, chopped in pieces and cast to swine. Alas! what a
miserable fate lieth in store for all of us."</p>

<p>The Rani was about to reply when Ahmad interposed
angrily.</p>

<p>"What is all this thou sayest of the noble Prasad
Singh? Dost know that thou art accusing a high and
loyal prince of the vilest treachery. By the Prophet's
beard! were it not that I regard thee as but a half witted
fool, for such lies upon a friend, I would cut thee on the
spot into the pieces of which thou speakest."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>He made an impulsive motion with his hand toward
the hilt of his sword, but the Rani restrained him.</p>

<p>"Stay Ahmad," she enjoined. "Perchance somewhere
in all this mass of exaggeration there may lie a speck
of truth. You must admit Prasad's actions of late might
warrant a measure of suspicion."</p>

<p>"Noble Rani," replied Ahmad in a tone of excuse.
"That Prasad Singh may have been guilty of youthful
folly, that he has not paid due respect to your exalted
office and person, I will not deny; but that he should
harbor a single thought, far less attempt an act against
your authority, I will swear it to be a lie upon the sacred
book. Nay, more, I will defend his honor in such a
matter, with my sword, against whoever may make the
vile assertion."</p>

<p>"Ahmad," returned the Rani thoughtfully. "It is to
thy credit that thou dost behold Prasad only with the
eye of a friend; but I possess my own reason for searching
further into this matter. Now Bipin," she continued
addressing the secretary impressively, "state plainly,
and without resort to a riot of thy nervous fancy, what
thou hast actually seen and heard. As thou tellest the
truth thou wilt meet with recompense, but if thou liest,
I swear I will carry out the doom thou believest is in
store for thee."</p>

<p>With numerous checks upon his tendency to wander
from the main thread of his story, Bipin disclosed by
degrees a full account of what he had overheard at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
window of the hut outside the city. In spite of a strict
cross examination on the part of the Rani and Ahmad
Khan, he held steadfastly to two points, that it was
Prasad's voice he had undoubtedly heard in the treasonable
discussion, and that in his terrified condition he had
entirely forgotten the name of the wise man who had
conducted him to the spot.</p>

<p>Bipin's interrogation was brought finally to a conclusion.
The Rani dismissed him with the assurance that
he had acted wisely in her interest, and might fear no
evil from any direction.</p>

<p>"Well, my Lord," she asked of Ahmad. "What do
you now think of this"?</p>

<p>"Truly, noble Lady," he replied, "my understanding
is still unable to give credence to such a report. I cannot
believe it of my friend Prasad, staying as he is under
the shelter of my roof. By not a sign or word has he
intimated any such design to me. I thought him far too
much consumed with the fair Ganga's charms to care
for any project upon earth. Alas! one knows not what
to think. So noble a fellow to fall into such evil paths."</p>

<p>The Rani bit her lip and clenched her hands tightly
to restrain the burst of jealous passion called to the surface
of her nature by the Mohammedan's insidious thrust.</p>

<p>"Noble Rani," petitioned Ahmad, "I beg thou wilt
permit me to return immediately to my house. There,
I will cautiously sound the noble Prasad on this matter,
and if I find a grain of truth in the report, so display to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
him the ingratitude, the wickedness of such thoughts,
that surely will he express his sorrow and hasten to thy
presence abjectly craving pardon."</p>

<p>"Ah"! cried the Rani with bitter resentment in her
voice. "If it be true, think not that I will accept his
repentance or grant a pardon. Nay Ahmad, thou art
not to breathe a word of this to any mortal being, or thou
shalt fall under my unchangeable displeasure. For the
moment it is my intention to be present at this meeting
in the tomb of Firoz Khan, and if he be found plotting
this damnable deceit, may the Gods of India help him,
for the Rani will show no mercy."</p>

<p>The darkness concealed a smile of supreme triumph
on the Mohammedan's face.</p>

<p>"As thou commandest, noble one," he replied in a
voice of regretful emotion. "I pray to <i>Allah</i> that it may
be proved this fool's wits have gone far wandering than
that my friend doth contemplate such inconceivable
treachery. How doth the noble Rani purpose to act
further"? he asked.</p>

<p>"That, Ahmad, I am considering," she replied.</p>

<p>She continued in a part soliloquy:</p>

<p>"If Prasad is bent upon this mischief, there is no doubt
he will gather to his side a following. Divide Bipin's
last total in half, and there would yet remain thirty unhanged
rascals. Why should not I number myself as one
of them"?</p>

<p>"But consider the danger, noble Lady," protested Ahmad.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
He was astonished at the daring of the Rani's
project.</p>

<p>"What care I for danger"? she returned in an off-hand
manner. "Surely you, above all men, will not deny that
in the peril of a desperate situation, there lies more charm
than can be gained from watching yonder seductive
<i>natch</i>."</p>

<p>"Aye for a man of arms, fair Lady. But thou art a
woman."</p>

<p>"And a Maratha born," she answered significantly.
"Forget not that, O Ahmad. Not even yet dost thou
know the Rani of Jhansi. By God's favor I will some
day, perhaps, fight sword in hand on horseback with the
bravest of you."</p>

<p>The dauntless spirit of her nature appealed to a counterpart
in the Mohammedan's character in a way that no
other human quality could have done. Though he realized
it not, it was this force of her being that held him bound
to her service, in a sense, a comrade, as much as he was
a lover.</p>

<p>He murmured a genuine tribute of his admiration.</p>

<p>"Truly, I will not say thee nay, brave Rani. But how
then wouldst thou proceed. Surely thou wilt not go alone
into this affair"?</p>

<p>"No," she resumed. "I do not intend Prasad to gain
quite so much advantage. One against thirty would be
too unequal odds to combat. With me, Rati, shall number
another of these villains, and within the summons of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
voice, thou wilt hold my Valaiti bodyguard in some convenient
place of hiding. Such can be done, can it not,
good Ahmad"?</p>

<p>"I know just such a place close to the tomb," he replied.</p>

<p>"Then it is well or ill," she replied, "whichever way
we may regard it. To-morrow I, too, will keep an unexpected
tryst with Prasad at the tomb of Firoz Khan,
and if he be there, as it hath been reported, the Rani will
herself determine how to deal with him. Come! let us
return now to the <i>natch</i>. Let no one suspect that anything
hath gone amiss."</p>

<p>Ahmad paused with a gesture of appeal.</p>

<p>"May I not, O just Rani, say but one word for him
who is my friend"?</p>

<p>"Nay, not one," she answered. "If he be found innocent
he hath committed no offense against the Rani;
if guilty, he hath well merited his punishment. Come"!
she urged impatiently.</p>

<p>With dejected mien, Ahmad obediently followed.</p>

<p>When the natch was over, he strode hurriedly from
the palace. He made his way quickly to Mohurran
Goshi's home, and called the astrologer from his slumbers.</p>

<p>"But a word with thee, learned Doctor," he whispered
at the door. "Our star could not shine brighter. All
goes well; but the Rani and one of her women are to
make two of Prasad's following. Dost understand"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>The astrologer intimated that he would look to the
addition of two to the original number, provided for the
Hindu noble's purpose.</p>

<p>"Then good fortune to us all," concluded Ahmad.
"The shadow of the accursed Prasad vanishes as beneath
the sun at noonday."</p>

<h2>Chapter XIV<br />

<i>AT THE TOMB OF FIROZ KHAN</i></h2>


<p>The city of the Rani slept. The bazaars and side
streets were deserted. But for an occasional
light gleaming fitfully through a half opened
casement, and the dark forms of sentinels pacing
back and forth in noiseless tread upon the walls, Jhansi
might have been a city of the dead. In countless, glittering
myriads, the heavenly bodies strode majestically in their
eternal courses above the silent night. By the mercy of
the supreme Parem-eswara, the labor of the day completed
with the departing sun, the people had lain down to rest;
their joys, sorrows, hopes, for a space, gathered into
oblivion. Thus Jhansi slept.</p>

<p>Three figures habited in male attire approached the
eastern gate, and gave a password. The gate was slowly
opened, and the three went forth. Behind them, the massive
portals swung back into place upon grating hinges.</p>

<p>Direct from the lofty, frowning bastion, a road led
toward the summer palace on the borders of the lake.
Here and there clumps of tamarind and acacia rose indistinctly
on either side of the way. Rapidly, yet with
caution to avoid intercepting the nocturnal adventure of
some poisonous reptile, the three directed their steps
along the road. Their feet impressed the thick coating of
dust noiselessly. Not a word was exchanged, and no
sound broke upon their ears save the occasional yelping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of a startled cur or the dismal cry of a jackal summoning
a companion to a scent of prey. Once, only, a solitary
figure met them at a little distance from the city. If
bent upon evil, he concealed his purpose by a greeting of
peace.</p>

<p>"The blessing of God be with you," he cried.</p>

<p>"And with you, O Stranger, peace," the foremost of
the three answered in a woman's voice, despite the conflicting
evidence of her dress.</p>

<p>Presently they came to a parting of the road. A narrow
path led amid a growth of trees to the brink of the
lake. Massively the white square walls of the tomb of
Firoz Khan, with its central dome became visible through
the branches. The party halted.</p>

<p>"What now, my Lord"? the owner of the voice that
had returned the wayfarer's salutation asked.</p>

<p>"Noble Rani," that of Ahmad Khan replied, "yonder
is our destination. Behind the wall thou canst just
discern to the right, lie, well concealed, a hundred of thy
Valaiti bodyguard; but I know not if the conspirators
are assembled."</p>

<p>At the moment a white cloth was waved thrice above
the wall. Ahmad evidently took it for a signal. He spoke
in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Whoever the villains may be, they are now gathered
together. Here I will leave thee to pass in hiding to
the guard, while if thou art still determined upon the enterprise,
thou hadst better advance boldly to the entrance.
For the rest, I make no doubt thine own judgment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
and discretion, will serve thee better than any advice
of mine."</p>

<p>"Well said, my faithful Ahmad," the Rani answered.
"Thou art certain to hear my call if need be from yonder
hiding place"?</p>

<p>"Were it softer than the note of the bulbul, fair Lady,
be assured, it would reach me even at the gate of Paradise."</p>

<p>Thus while Ahmad stealthily disappeared among the
trees, the Rani motioned her waiting woman to follow,
and proceeded fearlessly toward the entrance of the tomb.</p>

<p>That those within had taken measures to prevent a
surprise was demonstrated by a challenge the moment
that the Rani emerged into the open space about the
building.</p>

<p>"Stand! who comes"? a voice demanded.</p>

<p>The Rani replied promptly in firm accents. "Two
followers of the noble Prasad Singh."</p>

<p>A short period of consultation among the conspirators
apparently ensued. Without, the Rani awaited the answer
with deep emotion. Would the report prove true
or false, that he whom she loved was a traitor as well
as a libertine?</p>

<p>Presently the response came.</p>

<p>"It is well, advance."</p>

<p>"Alas! it is ill," her heart murmured. "Ah God! the
ingratitude, the cruelty of it."</p>

<p>She advanced to the open door and entered the main
chamber of the tomb. A shaded lamp dimly illuminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
the interior. Her glance swept quickly from the five or
six armed men gathered in a group, to a stalwart form
she intuitively recognized as that of Prasad Singh, in
spite of the disguise he had assumed. He was pacing to
and fro a little apart from his companions, as if impatient
of some detail of his plan yet to be completed.</p>

<p>He turned quickly on her entrance and spoke in a
voice of stern rebuke.</p>

<p>"Thou art late," he exclaimed. "Thou hast kept us
waiting long after the appointed hour."</p>

<p>"Pardon, my Lord," replied the Rani, halting in the
dark shadow of a pillar. "Our steps were misdirected."</p>

<p>"A curse upon the muddled brain of that astrologer,"
he muttered. "Now hearken, while I tell thee briefly,
what I have impressed upon thy comrades at some length.
We go now to the city as belated travelers, with an admission
at the gate that hath already been assured. Thou
wilt then follow my steps quickly and silently to the
Rani's palace. As the others have their allotted duty,
thou wilt seek the garden gate and hold it securely
so that no one passes in or forth. If force be threatened
thou wilt in like manner threaten force, aye, and use it
if so need be. Thou hast arms"? he asked.</p>

<p>"Aye, noble captain," she replied. "Arms have we.
But if the Rani doth herself come forth. What then,
great sir"? she questioned in return.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt detain her above all others, though careful
to do her no personal harm," he enjoined emphatically.</p>

<p>"But should she command us to let her pass, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Lord"? she pressed still further, in a quiet, assumed
voice.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt obey the command of him who payeth thee
for thy service, thou idle questioner," he returned. "Thy
order is to hold her securely until my pleasure concerning
her hath been learned."</p>

<p>There followed a momentary pause, then her voice rose
solemnly to the vaulted roof.</p>

<p>"My Lord Raja, Prasad Singh, thou hast no need to
go to Jhansi for the Rani. Behold she is now before
thee."</p>

<p>She moved from the shadow and stood confronting him,
an expression of offended dignity visible upon her face.</p>

<p>He uttered an exclamation of surprise mingled with
dismay. Impulsively he strode forward.</p>

<p>"Stand where thou art," she commanded. "Move
not a pace, a man of you, for at the raising of my
voice a hundred troopers, lying at hand, will hasten to
my side."</p>

<p>With a muttered oath Prasad halted, while the Rani
turned to the door and summoned Ahmad.</p>

<p>Almost upon the instant the Mohammedan noble and
a score of the Rani's bodyguard appeared before the
entrance.</p>

<p>"Alas, Ahmad," she said. "Our hope is dashed in
pieces as a pitcher hurled upon a rock. Bipin, poor fellow,
hath earned my displeasure as well as my gratitude for
the truth that he has told. I would now, that I could
recompense him for being a liar concerning this night's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
work. Take these duped fools into safe keeping, and
then await my order. I will speak with Prasad first."</p>

<p>She motioned the shrinking forms inside the chamber
to pass without, and remained alone with Prasad.</p>

<p>For several minutes there reigned an unbroken silence,
as the Rani and her guilty lover stood face to face. The
moon had risen over the lake and sent its pale light
through a crevice in the dome of the ruined tomb. It
marked by deep shadows the recesses, and filled the
chamber with an atmosphere in sympathy with the chill
that seized upon the heart of the woman.</p>

<p>She spoke at last in a measured tone.</p>

<p>"How, now, my Lord Prasad Singh. A short while
since you said the Rani was to be held until she heard
your pleasure. Behold, she now patiently awaiteth it.
What wilt thou do with her"?</p>

<p>Prasad hesitated a moment, then cast himself at her
feet.</p>

<p>"Taunt me not, noble one," he petitioned. "I do not
seek thy pardon; but I do ask thee to hear me speak."</p>

<p>"Aye, will I," came the response coldly. "Is it not to
hear what thou canst say for such surprising conduct
that I am now waiting on thy words."</p>

<p>"As God sees my heart, my sole excuse is my all consuming
love for thee."</p>

<p>"Thy love for me," she echoed. "Surely it is a most
unusual way of showing it, good Prasad. Thou gatherest
here a company of rascals to assault my palace, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
order them to heed not my command, to hold me a prisoner
until I shall learn thy pleasure. Thy love for me.
Oh"! she cried with a note of scorn in her voice. "Thou
must indeed cherish a constant love for me."</p>

<p>"Ah, fair one, be not so ungracious," he besought her.
"Surely thou hast tried me more than I was able to
endure."</p>

<p>"I tried thee," she repeated bitterly. "Aye, I did try
thee, and thou hast proved to be most woefully amiss.
What art thou, a drinker of spirits, a libertine, and Ah
God! a traitor to thy Queen."</p>

<p>Stung by her accusations he sprang passionately to his
feet.</p>

<p>"It is not true," he retorted hotly. "Upon all things
sacred do I swear to it."</p>

<p>"Aye, thou art in a fitting situation for thy oath to
carry weight," she answered; "but, believe me I care not
for thy escapades with <i>natch</i> girls, or thy drunken orgies.
Of such I do not look for an account. Thy reason for
this company is what I seek."</p>

<p>"Some accursed villain hath betrayed me," he muttered
fiercely. "That dog of an astrologer, or can it be my
good Moslem friend, the noble Ahmad Khan"?</p>

<p>"Nay," she replied sorrowfully. "It is thine own false
heart, O Prasad, that hath betrayed thee. I know of no
astrologer, and as for Ahmad Khan, thou art only adding
an injustice to thy other wickedness by slandering the
fidelity of a friend. Even when this villainy of thine was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
made plain to me, he it was who stood firm as a champion
of thy miserable faith. I doubt not that now his heart is
sore with grief."</p>

<p>"Then fair Lady," he exclaimed. "Since the Gods
have willed it, that I shall appear in thine eyes as the
vilest of creatures, life hath no more object. Take it, O
Rani. I yield it to thee as readily here, as I would have
done for thee amid the press of battle."</p>

<p>He drew a dagger from his girdle and offered the
handle to the Rani. He bowed his head submissively.</p>

<p>She gazed upon him with sorrowful eyes. She took
the dagger from him and for a moment grasped it
tightly. Would she plunge it to his heart? He waited
resignedly. It would be an act of mercy was his only
thought.</p>

<p>Then she spoke in slow accents, first sternly, but toward
the close with a quaver in her voice.</p>

<p>"As the Rani, I could, O Prasad, kill thee; but as
Lachmi Bai thou&mdash;thou art forgiven. Oh! why hast thou
thus treated me"?</p>

<p>The dagger flashed with a clatter to the pavement; her
hand dropped listlessly to her side.</p>

<p>With a sudden burst of joy in his heart and arms
outstretched, he stepped forward, prompted by an impulse
of the moment.</p>

<p>She waved him back imperiously.</p>

<p>"Nay, I command, do thou not touch me. If thou
art forgiven by Lachmi Bai, thou art not pardoned by
the Jhansi Rani. Thy life she hath returned to thee that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
thou mayest redeem thine honor by honorable deeds, but
thou canst not remain in Jhansi."</p>

<p>He drew back with dejection stamped upon his face.</p>

<p>She turned to the door and summoned Ahmad Khan.</p>

<p>The Mohammedan responded with reluctant steps. He
paused on beholding Prasad, sighed deeply, and directed
his eyes toward the ground.</p>

<p>"Ahmad," she commanded. "It is my wish that thou
dost now conduct the noble Prasad Singh safely to the
boundary of the state. He doth leave me with a message
to the Rao Sahib."</p>

<p>She added this from the desire to screen the Hindu
noble's public downfall.</p>

<p>"Noble Lady," petitioned Ahmad, ignoring her intention.
"Thou placest on my shoulders too heavy a
burden. Prasad Singh hath grown to be my friend. I
cannot regard or hold one as a prisoner who hath so
recently been my honored guest. I beg thou wilt depute
this unhappy duty to another, such as thy faithful servant,
the Dost Ali Khan, now without."</p>

<p>"By Heaven"! cried Prasad angrily, a wave of jealousy
sweeping all other feeling to the winds. "To such
indignity I will not submit."</p>

<p>He stooped and seizing the dagger that had remained
upon the floor, stood at bay defiantly.</p>

<p>For a moment surprise was depicted on the Rani's face,
then she sought his reason.</p>

<p>"Why dost thou so object to the escort of Dost Ali"?
she asked innocently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thou askest me why I should object to this Dost
Ali"? he retorted. "No," he laughed mockingly. "In
pleasant company forsooth with thy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something in the Rani's expression appealed direct
to his sense of honor, checking him in the utterance of
the final word. Fortunately it died upon his lips unspoken.</p>

<p>As if she had penetrated his meaning the Rani started,
her countenance menacing with sudden passion. She
clutched Ahmad so tightly by the wrist that he was
forced to set his teeth to withhold an oath of pain.</p>

<p>The situation was also critical for him. If the Rani
were to accept the implied challenge of her virtue, the
result might be a disclosure of his deep intrigue.</p>

<p>The danger, for Ahmad, passed as she replied with an
effort of controlled emotion.</p>

<p>"Truly thou art mad, O Prasad. Thy folly and
passion doth almost accomplish its inevitable end.
Fortunate is it, those who wish thee well have pity for
thee. To reason with thee would only be an act, equally
insane."</p>

<p>She walked toward him fearlessly and laid her hand
upon the dagger hilt.</p>

<p>"Come," she enjoined. "Thou hast surrendered.
Thou shalt obey my will within my state, even if it be
my pleasure that Dost Ali doth accompany thee to the
boundary."</p>

<p>"A curse upon thy pleasure," retorted Prasad sullenly,
relinquishing the dagger to her hand. "The sooner that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
my feet are free from this unlucky soil, perchance the
more quickly will I gain some peace of mind. I care
not how I leave it, so I ride forth speedily."</p>

<p>"Ah! in truth, good Prasad, how well dost thou display
thy penitence," she answered reproachfully. "This
dagger will I hold as a pledge for thy better nature yet
to claim. Farewell, my Lord. I pray a kindlier fortune
may attend our next meeting."</p>

<p>She moved toward the door, and pausing, turned upon
him a look of deep regret.</p>

<p>Prasad's countenance betrayed no change of feeling.</p>

<p>The Rani passed out into the moonlight, where her
troopers had grouped themselves about the tomb. Ahmad
followed. He begged to know her wish concerning
the other prisoners.</p>

<p>"Carry them also to the boundary," she ordered, "and
let them go to whatever place God wills. I pray I may
never set eyes on one of them again."</p>

<p>"Doth the Rani now wish to return to Jhansi"? he
asked, "or will she accept the poor hospitality of Ahmad
Khan. His house is within a little distance."</p>

<p>"Not now, good Ahmad," she replied. "I would be
for a short time alone. Remain here with those unneeded
for the escort, while I go yonder to the shrine. Presently
I will return."</p>

<p>She acknowledged the salute of the officers as they
gazed with wonder on her masculine attire, and moved
slowly amid the trees to the temple of the great god of
Hindustan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thanks be to Allah," Ahmad murmured devoutly.
"This night is mine."</p>

<p>Black was the heart of the Mohammedan. The night
was his&mdash;a night of hell riot loosened in his soul. Passion
and murder struggled for the first place in his intention.
Blood was already on his hands. Like a tiger his thirst
for more was now unquenchable.</p>

<p>Mohurran Goshi called to his door earlier in the evening
had received his unreckoned due. Ahmad's dagger
had forever settled the account between them. The wise
discerner of other's good and evil fortune, had failed to
calculate his own swiftly approaching end.</p>

<p>In like manner a secret order to Dost Ali was to terminate
the conspirators' existence. Ahmad quickly
planned that in some dark ravine, before the boundary
was reached, the deed might be easily accomplished.
Prasad to be dispatched in revenge, the others as a safer
fetter than money upon their silence. He quickly selected
the escort, and then drew Dost Ali to one side.</p>

<p>"It is the Rani's command, O discreet Ali," he said in
an undertone, "that these rascals are to be conducted to
the boundary; but thou wilt easily gather her implied
meaning. She declared she doth hope never to set eyes
on any one of them again. Dost understand, she trusteth
to thy sword, that not one of them may by chance
return."</p>

<p>Dost Ali drew himself up and replied tersely.</p>

<p>"I understand her command that they are to be set
free at the boundary."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"By Allah"! exclaimed Ahmad petulantly. "Thy
mind doth evidence little penetration. Clearly she doth
not wish them to be set free at the boundary, but in some
convenient spot dispatched from further harm."</p>

<p>"If such be her meaning," replied the other firmly,
"she must express it thus to me in words. Too well do
I know my duty to place an interpretation of my own
upon her plain command. As the order stands, I will
escort them to the boundary."</p>

<p>An exclamation of impatience burst from Ahmad's lips.
The moment was opportune for a still more wicked design.
It left him no time to argue the matter further.</p>

<p>"Then get thee gone upon thy business," he retorted
angrily. "For all my trouble I see thou art poorly witted
to rise in favor at the Rani's court. Thy stupidity will
interpose between a great reward."</p>

<p>"To obey an order strictly was ever the injunction of
my illustrious teacher, Dost Mohammed Khan," the young
officer replied firmly. "Alone, by so doing, do I seek
reward."</p>

<p>He saluted Ahmad haughtily, and turned to order the
mounting of his command.</p>

<p>"A curse upon the fool," muttered Ahmad fiercely.
"Who could have reckoned on a conscience from the
Afghan school? But that the hour has come to gratify
a yearning hunger, I would beat submission to his brain."</p>

<p>He bade the rest of the troopers await his return, and
set forth in the opposite direction taken by the Rani.
When beyond the range of observation from the tomb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
he turned, and quickly but cautiously made a <i>detour</i> with
the temple also, as his destination.</p>

<p>In his mind he beheld the woman of his passionate
desire, practically alone and unprotected. To the priests
and attendants he wasted not a thought. They would
fly in terror at the first cry of alarm. She, for whom he
had jeopardized his soul by swearing falsely on the Koran
would then remain to suffer willingly or otherwise the
purpose of his mind. That the ground was sacred,
mattered not. Dedicated to a heathen God, it would have
been an act of his faith to slaughter the priests and raze
the building to the ground. More, was not she, also, an
unbeliever, given into his embrace by the will of God.
When accomplished, a swift horse in waiting, would, if
need be, carry him far distant from the vengeance of the
outraged woman. Of that he had not been unmindful.</p>

<p>The Rani had approached the temple with sorrow consuming
her heart. Her affection for Prasad had gone
forth spontaneously almost at their first meeting. She
had beheld in him what she believed to be her ideal of a
chivalrous noble. That he possessed failings due to youth
and inexperience she was ready to admit; but that he
should prove such a hopeless failure in all his qualities,
was a bitter disappointment. A drunkard, a consort of
other women, while he asserted his unalterable love for
her, a conspirator against her authority if not her person,
surely her affection could not have been bestowed upon a
more worthless object. Her temperament was not such
as to display her anguish by lamenting Prasad's faithlessness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and her own wrong into every willing ear; but
none the less was there the necessity to obtain relief by
an outpouring of her spirit. In secret, before the great
God she worshipped, she purposed to seek consolation
for her wounded heart; then to go forth and bear outwardly
before her people no trace of her inward grief.</p>

<p>The temple was wrapt in silence. In the outer building
white robed, recumbent figures of priests and attendants
lay here and there where they had chosen a resting
place. With hushed steps the Rani stole past these,
crossed a courtyard, and entered the chamber of the God.
Save for the glow from an incense burner, the interior
was veiled in darkness, to emphasize the unknown mysterious
element of Siva's being. Before her, the figure
of the God loomed a darker object, seated upon an altar
pedestal, wrapt in profound, eternal meditation. The
morrow was a festival and flowers had already been bountifully
scattered upon the altar, and, in wreaths, hung
about the person of the sacred image. She stood for a
moment before the shrine, then knelt in prayer.</p>

<p>"O great Siva," she petitioned. "All wise, all powerful,
all just God, Protector of Animals, Vanquisher of
Death; thou, whose vision and understanding doth penetrate
all things from the infinitude of Heaven to the deepest
secrets of the human soul, behold the unhappiness of
thy daughter. Striving to be just yet ever suffering
injustice, to appease jealousy but to behold new dissension
rise on every hand, and O Holy God, loving only
to receive ingratitude and faithlessness in return. Give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
me, I beg of thee, above all things, a spirit of resolute
courage to combat the vicissitudes of life, and to hold
death powerless of terror in whatever form it shall come.
Aye, and O Great God, give to me this divine quality so
that I may inspire the faltering hearts of others, if need
be to valiant deeds for the honor of our faith and country."</p>

<p>She raised her face upward to the protecting hands
of the God, and remained thus in silent communion.</p>

<p>Ahmad Khan, too, approached the temple, and passed
by the sleeping figures. With noiseless tread he crossed
the court, and stood upon the threshold of the shrine.
Before him, the woman still knelt in wrapt devotion. For
a moment his eyes feasted on her captivating form. Ah
<i>Allah!</i> his at last.</p>

<p>With the prize seeming to his hand, the intoxication
of the moment stayed his grasp. His opportunity was
lost. A cry near by, shrill and prolonged, as of a beast
relentlessly attacked by some more powerful adversary,
rose upon the night. It echoed within the temple. The
Rani started to her feet as Ahmad took a hasty stride
forward. She seized a torch at hand and thrust it into
the incense burner. Then facing him, she held it high
above her head.</p>

<p>Ahmad halted suddenly and trembled.</p>

<p>The figure of the Rani, majestic and awe inspiring,
posed before the dark image of the God, thrilled his soul
with a first sensation of terror. She appeared to gaze
full upon him, yet beheld him not. Her stature seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
rise visibly before his eyes. The light of the torch flaring
upward cast into strong relief the ornate decorations of
the shrine, the countenance of Siva no longer buried in
thought; but, in his non-Aryan aspect, wrathful and
menacing. Her lips moved, but no sound came forth.
She appeared to be enveloped in an ecstatic dream.</p>

<p>Before his fixed gaze, strange beings floated in the air.
Ancient Vedic Gods, the bright and shining ones. Indra
the rain bringer, Agni the God of fire, Vayu of the wind,
Rudra the ruler of the tempest; their very names long
since buried in oblivion to the multitude.</p>

<p>They gathered about the transfigured form of the Rani,
as if to protect her from a shadow of harm.</p>

<p>Was the scene but the effect of a feverish imagination?
In contradiction to the tenets of his religion, superstitious
of all that was visionary and inexplicable, Ahmad was
ready to believe the whole a dread reality, a manifestation
of divine blessing resting upon the head of the girl.</p>

<p>He would have cried aloud for mercy, but terror had
bereft his tongue of speech. He clasped his brow tightly.
For a moment he reeled, then fell to the pavement.</p>

<p>The night was lost and won.</p>

<h2>Chapter XV<br />

<i>IN THE COURSE OF EVENTS</i></h2>


<p>Many days had passed beneath the Rani's feet.
Almost hourly the loom of peril rose threateningly
upon her position. From every
source, with unrelenting persistence, the
worst news came to shatter the hopes of those who had
espoused the Native cause in Jhansi.</p>

<p>First the report of the recapture and looting of Delhi
was confirmed; to which was added the intelligence that
the aged Emperor was a prisoner in the enemy's hands,
and that his sons had been slaughtered. Then that Lucknow
was relieved, and the army of the Peshwa put to
flight. Reports of other reverses succeeded one another
with disheartening rapidity.</p>

<p>The hour of the Foreigners' vengeance had come.
Terror was the weapon they now wielded to crush the
rebellion. It was not without satisfactory result in the
interest of their dominion in India. The undisciplined
mobs led by generals suspicious of each other's actions
melted away before the impetuous onslaughts of the white
men. Many Native leaders sought to make peace while
the hour of grace lasted. Those still wavering quickly
made up their minds that they had ever loved the Foreigner
as a parent.</p>

<p>But for those taken in open revolt it was soon made
plain that there was to be no mercy. They were blown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
from the mouths of cannon to end their lives in this
world, and, according to the belief of the sentenced, to
exterminate their existence in the next. The demand rose
that as a lasting memorial of the triumph of the Christian
faith as well as of the Christian sword over both
Hindu and Mohammedan, temples should be converted
into churches, and that on every tile of the Great Mosque
at Delhi a martyr's name should be engraved.</p>

<p>In another part of the world the names of Christian
martyrs may be seen cut into the walls of subterranean
passages bearing witness to a triumph of their faith
brought about by other means. But it was the Nineteenth
and not the Third Century. It was Cawnpur and
not the Coliseum to be avenged.</p>

<p>Reports of these things, also, came to the Rani's ears.</p>

<p>"See," she cried, "how faithfully do these Foreigners
observe the commandments of their gentle Prophet.
Were a Mohammedan conqueror raging through the land,
his injunction to plunder and spare none could not be
more swiftly obeyed."</p>

<p>With the news of each fresh disaster, the number of
dismayed faces turned toward the Rani increased proportionately;
but upon her countenance there was no
reflection of the weakening sentiment. Her spirit rose
as that of an eagle threatened with the destruction of
its young. She realized that time was bringing for her,
a supreme test of forethought and endurance, as well as
of courage.</p>

<p>As she had surprised all with the wisdom displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
in the conduct of her civil government&mdash;a curious reproach
to those who had regarded her as incapable to
occupy a throne&mdash;her military judgment was marked by
intuitive sagacity of the highest merit.</p>

<p>On the ramparts of the rock fortress new guns were
mounted commanding the whole plain; the massive walls
surrounding the city on its three other sides were repaired;
the mamelon, or mound, at the south-east corner,
together with several flanking bastions, armed, so that
they bristled with guns. With untiring perseverance she
had collected and trained to a state of efficiency a defending
force of eleven thousand men, every one of whom
had sworn to defend her person and honor to the last
extremity.</p>

<p>Thus her outward life displayed no sign of the unhealed
wound in her heart. Of Prasad, she had received
no intelligence directly. Rumor had upon occasion reported
his presence with the standard of the Native general,
Tantia Topi, so far victorious and vanquished in
turn. Ahmad Khan still remained as the most obedient
of her lieutenants.</p>

<p>From the pavement of the temple he had risen to go
forth with a new feeling regarding her. The element
of his passion still remained, but the absence of his rival
cast the stimulant of jealousy into abeyance, and a belief
that in some way her person was sacred, prevented any
present contemplation of a renewal of his suit to the
point of overt action. Once only had he ventured with
humility to touch upon his unrequited sentiment. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
quickly divined the purpose of his mind, and interposed
before a declaration.</p>

<p>"Greatly do I appreciate thy faithful service, O Ahmad,"
she said, "and in the strife I fear is quickly approaching,
there is no one of whose aid I would less willingly
be deprived; but of thy longing for my deeper
affection thou must not speak again. Long since have I
given my love to the welfare of my people, to naught
else."</p>

<p>A sigh lightly escaped her lips. For a moment her
gaze passed from the immediate scene. Perhaps it sought
the figure of a young noble fighting bravely on some far
off battlefield.</p>

<p>"Fair Lady," Ahmad petitioned. "Canst thou not
give me but a grain of hope"?</p>

<p>"Hope, Ahmad," she replied evasively, "of one kind
and another we may each cherish. It is well, for we
know not what lies before us on the morrow. Alas! we
are as butterflies dancing in the sunlight. A cloud
sweeps across the Heavens, and behold, we and our hopes
have vanished."</p>

<p>With the worthy secretary, Bipin Dat, unhappy even
in the happiness of the banishment of his fancied enemy,
and relief from the terrors held over him by his late
counselor, Mohurran Goshi; he was not slow to discover
another astrologer, who was quite ready to lighten the
weight of a well filled purse, in exchange for prognostications
of extraordinary good fortune. But the secretary's
horoscope was, it seemed, ever temporarily clouded by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
ominous signs, that could be dispelled for a consideration.
As with others of the populace, a real terror rose above
the horizon in the threatened return of the Foreigners.
It served to recall to Bipin's mind the fact that a long
period had elapsed since he had visited his family, dwelling
in a province removed from the seat of war. It was
a remarkable coincidence that with the daily advent of
evil tidings, this filial sentiment grew stronger within
him. By day it interfered with his digestion; at night
it disturbed his rest. A final decision was brought about
through the attempt of a creditor to recover an overdue
account. Money that should have repaid the services
of his barber, had been diverted into the rapacious purse
of the new astrologer; and the barber was wrathful, even
vindictive, in consequence. He took the usual course to
enforce payment by an endeavor to shame the unworthy
secretary in public.</p>

<p>Bipin sat in the shade of a pillar endeavoring to propitiate
the barber with compliments, while a blunt razor
was unmercifully scraped back and forth over his head.
The mirror he held, in which to admire his features during
the progress of his toilet, reflected a wry countenance.</p>

<p>"A handsome boy, that is of yours, most skilful Barber,"
he remarked; as the barber grasped his customer's
nose in a tight pinch.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," returned the barber dryly. "As thou sayest,
I would like him to enter the Rani's service but that
all her attendants will shortly be killed. <i>Ah, hae!</i> Alas!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
The Foreigners now advancing will not let one of them
escape."</p>

<p>He swept the razor significantly across Bipin's throat.</p>

<p>Bipin started.</p>

<p>"What is that you say"? he asked.</p>

<p>"Be careful, good sir," enjoined the barber, "or I
might damage an ear destined for the Foreigners to cut
off, after the city has been carried by assault."</p>

<p>Bipin shivered both in body and spirit. He mentally
cursed the fate that seemed bent upon depriving him of
his organs.</p>

<p>"Thou art a chicken hearted rogue of a barber," he
replied excitedly, in an endeavor to overcome the shock
to his courage. "Dost know that her Highness numbers
among her followers some of the bravest fighters in
the land, who will drive away the Foreigners as deer before
tigers. Though not born to the sword, if such
danger comes, I, myself, will bear arms and fight upon
the walls."</p>

<p>The barber laughed tauntingly. His object was to incite
the secretary's anger to the point of an open squabble,
so that he could then proclaim his wrong and obtain payment
through the adverse criticism that would fall on
Bipin's head.</p>

<p>"You fight, worthy Secretary," he sneered. "Why a
jackal would laugh at your valor. You would run at
the first discharge of a gun, but that you are too fat, too
corpulent."</p>

<p>Bipin struggled out of the barber's clutches, burning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
with passion, half shaved, a delightful object of
ridicule.</p>

<p>"Too fat," he gasped, striking the barber with the
palm of his hand. "Too fat, thou lean ghost. If the
accursed Foreigners catch thee, be assured thy bones will
rattle well from the bough of a tree."</p>

<p>Instantly the hubbub the barber looked for rose. A
dozen bystanders interfered, barking dogs rushed from
corners, a score of voices clamored in the interest of
they knew not what. Above it all, the wail of the barber
proclaimed the secretary's remissness in his payment.</p>

<p>Bipin soon perceived the disadvantage of his situation.
He was in the wrong, that was made plain. Reluctantly
he drew forth the required sum and begged the offended
barber take his money.</p>

<p>The offended barber at first swore by his God not to
touch the smallest coin, but at last yielded to persuasion.
He even accepted an additional payment as a solace for
the personal affront, declared Bipin was to him as an
uncle, and vowed that unless permitted to proceed with
the shaving, the joy of his life would go out.</p>

<p>Thus peace was restored, the dogs slunk back to their
corners, the bystanders directed their attention to other
matters, and Bipin again gave his head to the hands of
the now obsequious barber. But his mind was ill at ease.</p>

<p>"The razor shaves to your liking, I trust, great sir,"
remarked the barber, as he removed the roots as well as
the stems of a tuft of Bipin's hair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Bipin groaned with the pain, but from oft repeated
similar experiences, continued to submit patiently.</p>

<p>"At least no worse than usual," he muttered in response.
"But tell me what thou hast heard about the
return of the Foreigners."</p>

<p>"Oh, little of any consequence," replied the barber
light-heartedly. "They are on the road that will surely
carry them off the face of the earth. The Rani's troops
will rout them utterly. Thou wouldst make a fine soldier,
worthy Secretary," he added in accents of admiration.
"A brave figure on a horse."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," returned Bipin dubiously. "What you
say may be true, but at present I am considering another
matter of importance. When is it reported in the
bazaars that these Foreigners are likely to arrive"?</p>

<p>"Noble Secretary, that is not certain. Indeed, it is the
general opinion they will never arrive except as prisoners."</p>

<p>The expression on Bipin's face did not reflect the barber's
sudden optimism. In his mind he beheld the much
more secure retreat afforded by the abode of his family
while the road was still open. At the conclusion of his
toilet he sought the Rani's presence.</p>

<p>A secret council of war had just been held. A messenger
that morning had brought news of the rout of the
Native army at Mandanpur only eighty miles distant
from Jhansi, leaving the whole intervening country exposed,
with the single exception of the fort of Chanderi.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
There was no longer any doubt of the swift approach
of the enemy, the only question being whether to give
battle at some advantageous point, or defend the city until
a relieving force could arrive under Tantia Topi. The
question still awaited a final decision. The Rani herself
was in favor of the former course, while her officers,
with the exception of Ahmad Khan, strenuously urged
the latter as more prudent. Another council was to meet
later in the day upon the receipt of further expected intelligence.</p>

<p>Bipin <i>salaamed</i> and proceeded to introduce his request
for leave of absence to visit his family, by a complimentary
preface on the peaceful condition of all things
under the shadow of the Rani's authority.</p>

<p>"Peace it may be for the moment, good Bipin," she
interposed, in his word ramble over the whole State of
Jhansi. "But assuredly to-morrow will find us all with
arms in our hands."</p>

<p>Bipin affected astonishment. As he had been excluded
from the council of war the news of the near approach
of the Foreigners had not reached his ears. Was it possible
that some audacious raja contemplated a revolt?
he asked. Undoubtedly he would soon be brought to
terms, and the Rani continue to reign undisturbed for
evermore.</p>

<p>The Rani shook her head seriously.</p>

<p>"Thou wilt hear of it all quickly enough," she replied.
"But in the meantime what is it thou desirest,
for assuredly thou hast a petition"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Bipin then launched forth into the disturbed state of
his conscience on account of the long period which had
elapsed since he had beheld his dear parents, his honored
uncles, his worthy brothers, and all the host of his
other relatives.</p>

<p>"Alas! noble Lady," he reflected contritely. "What
will they think of their undutiful son. Most unfortunate
would it be if they should consider that in the exalted
state in which it has pleased your Highness to place me,
I had forgotten their less fortunate condition. To explain
that only the burden of my office has kept me from
them, is the object of my seeking a few days absence
from your Illustrious Greatness's side."</p>

<p>The Rani smiled in spite of the anxiety in her mind.</p>

<p>"That is surely a most estimable desire, O Bipin," she
replied. "But I would suggest that instead of taking so
toilsome a journey, thou dost make thy regrets by letter,
accompanied by a handsome present out of thy savings.
In that way, be assured, they will be well satisfied."</p>

<p>Bipin's round face lengthened. The suggestion did not
at all coincide with his present inclination.</p>

<p>"Noble Lady," he resumed gravely. "This would
I gladly do, but that there are some family matters
that can only be discussed with propriety by word of
mouth."</p>

<p>"Then, good Bipin, thou must depart, I suppose," she
replied, "though we shall be the loser by thy absence.
But thou must use great caution on the journey," she
added naively, "for the horsemen of the Foreigners may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
have already swept to the north, and if they catch thee,
as a servant of the Jhansi Rani, I fear thou wilt never
behold the faces of thy genial uncles."</p>

<p>An expression of indecision broke over Bipin's countenance.
In that case, he quickly reasoned, the walls of
Jhansi would undoubtedly be a safer retreat than the open
highway.</p>

<p>"Then, perhaps, great Rani," he faltered, "I had better
defer my visit for a season. Not for a mountain of gold
would I be absent from thy side in the hour of danger.
Upon my head would forever rest the reproach that I had
turned my heels to the enemy."</p>

<p>"Nay," she answered thoughtfully. "Thou mayest go
in safety, for as thy road lies by the camp of Tantia Topi,
thou canst be of service by bearing a message to him from
me. Thus far, an escort shall accompany thee. But thou
must be ready to start immediately."</p>

<p>Bipin's face brightened visibly.</p>

<p>"I am ready even now, noble Lady," he replied, "and
doubt not, will return with all speed in time to assist
in the defeat of the Foreigners, should they venture to
direct their steps toward Jhansi."</p>

<p>"Then take thy writing materials and set down as I
dictate," she commanded.</p>

<p>Bipin produced a pen, a bottle of ink, and a pad; when
the Rani delivered an urgent message to the Maratha general,
setting forth the impending danger, and begging him
to come speedily to her assistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Within an hour Bipin's whole attention was directed
toward a heroic endeavor to keep his seat in the saddle
of a spirited horse, while the troopers unsympathetically
set a rapid pace along the road to Charkari.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVI<br />

<i>JHANSI BESIEGED</i></h2>


<p>High above the city and the plain, from the
loftiest pinnacle of the fortress, the banner of
the Rani waved in proud defiance. The city
gates were still open to admit a few stragglers
fleeing to swell the overcrowded caravansaries. The incessant
bleating of goats and sheep, mingled with the
lowing of cattle, that rose above the human turmoil, proclaimed
forethought in sweeping the country bare of all
live stock, available as food for the advancing enemy.
With similar prudence, the already arid coloring of the
land had been hastened and intensified by the action of
the Rani, in setting fire to the scrub jungle for miles in
all directions. By this means the horses and baggage
animals of the invading force would be deprived of local
sustenance.</p>

<p>By the eastern gate a group of horsemen were held
in momentary readiness to dash forth upon an urgent
mission.</p>

<p>From a commanding point on the walls of the citadel,
the Rani, Ahmad Khan, Dost Ali, and others of her
officers, anxiously scanned the uneven horizon to the
southward. Her arms rested on the parapet from which
the rock fell away in a sheer precipice to the plain below.
To the east of the city beyond the lake, the waters of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Betwa, gleaming in the afternoon sunshine, wound a
sinuous course northward. Directly beneath, the ruined
bungalows of the Foreigners, the dismantled Star Fort
near the cantonments, and temples amid shading clumps
of tamarind, were indistinctly visible through the haze
resting lightly upon the surface of the land.</p>

<p>The decision had been taken to defend the city instead
of giving battle in the open. As a consequence the whole
of the troops had been withdrawn from the cantonments
to the walls. The latter presented an animated appearance,
manned at all parts ready for the advent of the
Foreigners.</p>

<p>The Rani gazing upon this scene, suddenly raised an
arm and pointing afar off to a defile in the broken country,
engaged Ahmad's attention.</p>

<p>"Look, my Lord," she cried. "Dost thou not make
out some horsemen advancing yonder"?</p>

<p>Ahmad shaded his eyes with his hand, and for a few
moments looked intently in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>"Aye," he replied at last. "They come on the Chanchanpur
road. It must be the vanguard of the enemy."</p>

<p>He leaned over the parapet as if by a more earnest
gaze to make sure of his opinion, then drew back with
confirmation written on his face.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly they are of the Foreign Sahib's army,
my Lady Rani," he said. "I can tell by the action of
their horses."</p>

<p>The Rani turned to a soldier standing to a gun near by.
She raised her hand as a signal. Immediately a tongue of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
flame and a puff of white smoke shot forth from the
muzzle of the cannon. The report that followed was
borne above the city and echoed amid the crevices of the
rock.</p>

<p>It had scarcely died away when similar reports boomed
from rampart to bastion along the circuit of the walls,
a prearranged warning of the Foreigners' approach.
Commotion was manifested on the defenses as the soldiers
hurried to their stations. Instantly the troop near the
eastern gate clapped spurs to their horses' flanks and
dashed forward on the road to Charkari. They bore a
message to Tantia Topi, that Jhansi had been invested,
and again called upon him for assistance. Behind them
the gates swung back upon their hinges, drawbridges
were raised, the siege of Jhansi had commenced.</p>

<p>The watchers on the citadel beheld the troop race for
life along the Charkari road. They also beheld, with consternation,
a flank movement by a detachment from the
main body of the Foreign cavalry to intercept the messengers'
escape.</p>

<p>"See, my Lord," the Rani cried anxiously, "the
Foreign cavalry are in pursuit of our horsemen."</p>

<p>Ahmad glanced quickly in their direction.</p>

<p>"Aye," he replied, "but I doubt if they can reach the
Betwa first."</p>

<p>The Rani's troop evidently perceived their danger for
their horses were urged on to greater speed. Could the
Betwa be reached they would be safe from further pursuit,
but it was yet a good five miles distant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus pursuers and pursued raced across the plain in
full view of those watching from the fortress. The Foreign
cavalry gained ground steadily in spite of the freshness
of the others' horses.</p>

<p>"Ahmad," suddenly exclaimed the Rani, as if an idea
had flashed upon her mind, "do thou go forth with
my bodyguard and seek to draw off the Foreigners; but
enter not into any rash engagement as we need every
life in the defense of Jhansi. Hasten, good Ahmad, for
Tantia Topi must not remain in doubt of our position."</p>

<p>Ahmad obediently hurried from her side, while the
Rani anxiously awaited the outcome of her order.</p>

<p>Presently from the eastern gate she beheld Ahmad
sweep forth at the head of a body of Valaiti troopers
with the object of, in turn, cutting off the Foreign cavalry.</p>

<p>This the Foreigners quickly noticed and wheeled about
to meet the new force.</p>

<p>The Rani clapped her hands joyfully, for the man&oelig;uvre
enabled her flying mission to gain an unrecoverable advantage.
She beheld them plunge to safety through the
waters of the Betwa.</p>

<p>Those on the walls also watched the movement and
cheered loudly upon its success.</p>

<p>In the gathering darkness Ahmad Khan then withdrew
his detachment to the shelter of the walls.</p>

<p>A sleepless night was spent by those in authority within
the threatened city. To a late hour the Rani sat in council
discussing final plans for the defense. A mandate
was issued calling upon every male able to bear arms to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
repair to the walls, and in her name, the Rani especially
appealed to the women and children to render assistance,
not in vain lamentations over the slain, but by carrying
food and water to those unable to leave their posts.</p>

<p>At daybreak the enemy's cavalry was reported to have
completely invested the city, and before night again came
round, the main body of their army had arrived and were
busily engaged erecting batteries from which to bombard
the walls. It was evident their intention was to capture
the entire garrison as well as the capital of the state.</p>

<p>A suggestion that the Rani should make her escape
while there might yet remain an opportunity, was received
by the fair defender with scorn.</p>

<p>"Fear not," she retorted with animation, "that I will
suffer the indignity of capture at their hands. My dead
body they may find, but the spirit of the Rani of Jhansi
will have carried more than one of them to an accounting
before the great tribunal of justice."</p>

<p>In two days the enemy's batteries were completed, then
the storm of war burst with full violence upon the city.
The garrison spiritedly returned the fire shot for shot
with many to the good, breaches were made in the walls
to be repaired by the hands of the women and children,
animated to heroic actions by the presence and inspiring
words of their beautiful queen, who seemed oblivious to
any form of danger. At all hours she visited the ramparts
to encourage her soldiers with stirring appeals.</p>

<p>Day by day, for seventeen in number, the duel of
cannon shot was kept up on both sides, while watchers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
on the Jhansi citadel cast their vision with anxious eagerness
across the Betwa to the north and west. Was Tantia
Topi going to abandon them to the mercy of the Foreigners?
The question forced itself upon their minds.</p>

<p>The situation was fast becoming desperate. Great
rents had been made in the solid masonry at strategic
points that could not be repaired. The dead and dying
numbered hundreds. The besieged began to fight not
with the hope of victory, but with the courage of despair.</p>

<p>At last the mamelon itself was reduced by the furious
cannonade, its guns silenced. A hand to hand conflict
seemed imminent. It was then the Rani performed an
act of sublime courage which inspired admiration even in
the eyes of her enemies.</p>

<p>Messenger after messenger had arrived at the palace
bearing on their faces expressions of dismay that told
without words of the terror seizing upon their hearts.
One at length brought the worst news yet received.</p>

<p>"My Lady Rani," he spoke hurriedly. "The parapet
of the mamelon is shot away, the breach momentarily
widens, Ahmad Khan who, although badly wounded, still
fights like ten thousand tigers, sends word that it must
shortly be abandoned. Alas! the troops are becoming
disheartened, and hesitate to obey their orders."</p>

<p>The spirit of the Rani rose upon the instant to confront
the impending calamity.</p>

<p>"No," she cried, "the mamelon shall not be captured,
while I have a voice to summon men to its defense."</p>

<p>She repaired quickly to her private apartments and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
arrayed herself in magnificent attire so that in the act
she contemplated there might be no doubt concerning her
personality. Then she called for a horse and rode swiftly
to the threatened spot.</p>

<p>As she approached the ramparts, evidences of the terrible
devastation wrought by the shell of the enemy confronted
her gaze. Broken walls, bodies horribly mangled
where they had fallen, the forms of the mortally wounded
writhing in their death agony, terrified faces cowering
behind any shelter that could be obtained. A wide gap
in the outworks of the mamelon proved that the fire of
the besiegers had done effective work.</p>

<p>A feeble cheer greeted the Rani's arrival. She allowed
it to pass unheeded. She dismounted, and without a
moment's hesitation, strode fearlessly, past ghastly forms
and over shattered blocks of masonry, toward the most
exposed part of the walls.</p>

<p>Panic-stricken men turned their eyes upon her in wonder.
A pulse of renewed courage began to throb in their
hearts on beholding her presence among them. What
was she about to do? they asked of each other in undertones.</p>

<p>Overhead the shot continued to rain a hail of destruction,
but she pressed onward to the broken summit of
the bastion. A shell struck the ground a few yards in
advance, sending a cloud of dust into the air and scattering
stones in all directions, but it did not cause her to
swerve a foot from her path.</p>

<p>Ahmad Khan perceived her danger and hurried to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
side. His appearance told of the severity of the last few
days of combat. One of his arms was suspended in a
sling, his turbanless head bandaged to close the wound
caused by the flying splinter of a rock, his stern visage
dirt begrimed, his beard matted with congealed blood.</p>

<p>"Where goest thou, fair Rani"? he asked anxiously.
"Turn back thy steps, I beg of thee. It is certain death
to go forward."</p>

<p>She waved him back imperiously.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid," she cried above the din of the
bombardment. "This scene is mine as a birthright. Did
I not tell thee, I was a true Maratha."</p>

<p>He fell back and stumbled after her at a little distance.</p>

<p>She lightly passed over the remaining obstacles and
mounted the broken parapet of the bastion. There in
full view of the besiegers, in full range of their guns,
she stood, a dauntless, defiant, superb figure of inspiring
courage to all beholders. A gentle breeze played with
her silken draperies. With a contemptuous smile she gazed
serenely toward the enemy's battery. Fire, if you dare,
seemed to be her challenge.</p>

<p>A gun that was quickly trained upon her could have
instantaneously hurled her into oblivion, and thereby
ended the siege of Jhansi. A soldier stood by it ready
to fire at the officer's command. But the order did not
come. To the credit of the chivalrous spirit of the
Foreign general, he enjoined that yonder heroic girl
should not suffer harm knowingly by his guns.</p>

<p>For several minutes she thus stood upon the threshold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
of eternity, gazing calmly into its unfathomed depths;
then turned and waved a hand encouragingly to those
whose upturned faces regarded her safety in the daring
act as an interposition of providence.</p>

<p>With a shout of renewed enthusiasm they rushed from
their places of shelter to reman the abandoned fort. The
roar of the bombardment rose higher than ever; but for
the moment the city was saved from assault.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVII<br />

<i>WITH SWORD AND TORCH</i></h2>


<p>A grand salvo of artillery burst from the guns
of the Jhansi fortress and was echoed by those
of the other bastions as a joyful salute to the
rising sun on that First of April. In the early
light of dawn the sentries on the citadel had discerned
far to the north-west the fluttering standards above the
massed army of Tantia Topi marching to their relief. As
it advanced across the Betwa the main body deployed into
a long line of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, twenty
thousand strong, with outspread wings to encircle the
besieging army and crush it without affording a chance
of retreat.</p>

<p>The gloom that on the night before had settled upon
every face within the city, gave place to countenances
transported with joy. The guns continued to thunder
the glad news, bugles sounded their inspiriting notes,
light hearts upon the walls gave expression to new hope
by shouts of defiance to the enemy, and by bursting into
the choruses of ancient war songs.</p>

<p>"The Foreigners are already beaten," they cried one
to another, in accents of frenzied exultation. "Not one
of them will escape."</p>

<p>But unfortunately for their own safety, they estimated
the resource and courage of the enemy in a forlorn situation,
at a computation that would have been their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
under similar circumstances. The Foreigners were apparently
not seized with a panic. Far otherwise, they
seemed to be making preparations for a desperate fight.
A victory for the Native army was not yet secured.</p>

<p>Early in the previous night the Rani had been informed
of the welcome intelligence, and at daybreak had
repaired to the citadel to watch the advancing host. She
there called to a consultation her chief officers to discover
the best means of assisting the Native general in
his supreme effort to relieve the city.</p>

<p>After a careful survey of the situation, Ahmad urged
the plan of sallying out in force at a critical moment of
the forthcoming battle and attacking the rear of the Foreign
army. It would undoubtedly throw their front line
into confusion and accelerate the complete rout of their
foes.</p>

<p>This was quickly acceded to by the others. The Rani
was about to give an order for the collecting of the force
near the eastern gate, when an unexpected development
of the enemy's plan stayed the command.</p>

<p>The Foreign general instead of marching with his whole
force to meet that of Tantia Topi, divided his command
into two parts, one to continue the bombardment of the
city, the other to give battle to the Native general in the
open. To the amazement of those on the citadel they
beheld a detachment of not more than fifteen hundred
strong set out to combat a force over thirteen times superior
in men, and almost as much more formidable in
guns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>A sortie from the city was thus for the moment considered
inadvisable, but the guns were ordered to return
the fire of the besieging batteries with redoubled vigor.
The men on the walls shouted and cheered to encourage
the onward sweep of their deliverers.</p>

<p>From her elevated position the Rani anxiously watched
the advance of the two forces toward each other,
the result of which, though there could scarcely be
any doubt, was fraught with so much consequence to
herself. If the Foreigners were beaten and Jhansi relieved,
the effect would be to enkindle the dying flames
of the rebellion all over India. A long period must
then elapse before Jhansi could again be threatened, if
indeed the Foreigners would ever reappear before its
walls.</p>

<p>But in the excitement of the momentous hour, other
thoughts were not absent from her mind. With Tantia
Topi was the sole object upon whom her real affection
rested. A meeting between Prasad and herself would
probably take place before the fall of night. What would
be his manner toward her? How would she receive
him? were questions to be answered. In the joy of victory
it was probable that on her side his past cruelty
would be forgiven, if not entirely swept from her memory.
But would he have learned wisdom in his banishment?
Would he better understand her nature and the difficulties
of her position? That she loved him still in spite
of his apparent worthlessness had never been a matter
of doubt. She leaned her arms upon the parapet wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
over what part of the advancing army he would
have been given the command.</p>

<p>Much time was not permitted for these reflections.
The Foreign general instead of waiting to be attacked,
threw consternation into both flanks of his foe by attacking
those positions with his cavalry and horse artillery
in impetuous onslaughts. The guns of both armies,
added to those of the city bastions and besieging batteries,
filled the air with smoke and the deafening sound of their
discharges. It became difficult for those on the city walls
to see clearly how the battle went. Still they cheered
their friends on lustily.</p>

<p>Presently the roar of the cannon on the plain slackened.
Were the Foreigners already vanquished the Rani hoped
and wondered. Then the cloud of smoke rolled away
disclosing to her appalled vision, not the Foreigners defeated,
but the relieving army cast into inextricable confusion.
Their wings had been doubled in upon the center
at the moment that the Foreign infantry had attacked that
vulnerable part, and the whole was being driven back
upon the second line in a hopeless rout. The shouts of
encouragement from the city walls ceased. It was perceived
that the victory was not already won, but lost.
No relief would come that day to the beleaguered garrison.</p>

<p>The Rani hastened to where her chiefs of staff were
gathered. She besought them to lead a sortie to draw
off the pursuing enemy. But they shook their heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
despondingly. They pointed out that it would be a fruitless
waste of life.</p>

<p>"If then there is not a soldier among you," she cried
passionately. "I will lead it myself."</p>

<p>"Valiant Rani," petitioned Ahmad. "Surely thou wilt
not accuse thy servant of cowardice, but it would be a
rash, a hopeless act, unless yonder batteries were first
silenced. Between them and the walls thy men would be
mown down as grass."</p>

<p>She appeared to comprehend the force of his advice,
though she stamped her foot and returned vehemently:</p>

<p>"If the day be lost, the Foreigners need not think
that Jhansi hath been captured. Go you," she cried, "and
see that rocks and trunks of trees are heaped about the
walls, so that if an assault is made there shall be many
broken skulls."</p>

<p>In the distance the Native army was retreating across
the Betwa, but the Foreign cavalry kept mercilessly upon
their heels. They set fire to the jungle to harass the
pursuit, but amid the flames and smoke the fight continued.
The retreat developed into a rout. Twenty thousand
men fleeing before a less number of hundreds.</p>

<p>Presently the sun went down, a blood red orb for a
moment resting on the horizon, ominous of the fate in
store for those within the city.</p>

<p>On all sides dejected faces surrounded the Rani. Even
Ahmad Khan maintained a gloomy silence in the despondency
it was evident he felt. One officer even had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
temerity to suggest a truce so that the enemy's terms
might be learned.</p>

<p>The Rani flashed upon him a look of intense scorn.</p>

<p>"Not while I live," she cried, "hadst thou better do
more than contemplate so cowardly an act. By Heaven!
had I but officers possessed with daring like yonder Foreigners,
they would not now be revelling in their victory.
Nay, Jhansi would never have been attacked. In truth,
I do not blame them for hanging all their prisoners. He
who lives to fall into their hands well deserves that disgraceful
fate. Surrender," she cried, "not while the Rani
of Jhansi lives to teach you how to fight."</p>

<p>Their sense of honor was stung by the reproach.</p>

<p>Each swore loudly that he was prepared to die by her
side.</p>

<p>"Aye, my Lords," she returned, "and I have in mind
a plan that will strike amazement into the hearts of our
enemies. Jhansi they shall never capture. I will first
make of it the greatest funeral pyre that has ever blazed
in India. It shall be even more sublime than that of
Chitor, when thirteen thousand Hindu women, led by
their Queen, cast themselves into a vast furnace, to save
their honor from a conqueror."</p>

<p>"Go," she commanded to Ahmad, "and see that firewood
is collected in houses in different parts of the town,
and here in the palace. When the walls are carried, we
will fire the city; when the palace is taken, it shall also
be burned; and lastly, when the citadel can no longer hold
out, the magazines shall be exploded; and the heavens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and earth stand appalled at the last act of a Hindu woman
defending her throne. Then let the Foreigners gather
what plunder they may from the mound of ashes that
was once the city of Jhansi. Truly history will record
no more wondrous <i>johur</i>."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The officers looked dumbfounded. Ahmad hesitated
to execute the order.</p>

<p>"Go," she cried, stretching forth an arm impatiently.
"It is my will. He who disobeys me at this hour is a
traitor. With my own hand I will relieve the Foreigners
of any vengeance on his account."</p>

<p>The officers left her presence marveling at her display
of spirit and determination.</p>

<p>She turned to her waiting woman and bade her bring
weapons from the palace armory.</p>

<p>"A dagger, I have, with the sharpest point ever yielded
to a woman, but pistols, good Rati, and see to it they
are well loaded; for perchance I shall be forced to take
my own life out of the hands of these Foreigners."</p>

<p>The girl departed and left her mistress alone.</p>

<p>The Rani drew from her girdle Prasad's dagger, and
gazed upon it thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Keen is this blade," she murmured, "and relentless.
Ah Prasad! How hath this day gone with thee, I
wonder? Far hence our next meeting may be destined
to take place. If living, I pray thou hast redeemed thine
honor by a score of wounds. If dead, that thy body lies
upon the field of battle."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>
<p>A quiver hovered about the corners of her lips. She
hid the dagger in the folds of her sari gathered over
her breast.</p>

<p>There was no question that the defensive power of
the Jhansi garrison was reduced to the last extremity.
They still manned the shattered walls, and massed about
the breaches, but the place could not hold out for any
length of time. One hope still remained. It was known
that the Raja of Banpur had collected a force at Kotra
within marching distance. To him, the Rani had dispatched
overnight an urgent summons to come speedily
to her assistance. But it was unknown if the messenger
had been able to pass the enemy's lines.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the elated Foreigners were making preparations
for the final assault.</p>

<p>It was delivered at daybreak on the second morning
after the defeat of the army of Tantia Topi.</p>

<p>Suddenly from positions of cover they dashed to those
parts of the defenses leveled by the fire of their batteries.
In the gray light of dawn bugles rang out on both sides
calling men to a ruthless slaughter of each other. For
a moment, a storm of bullets from the walls checked the
Foreigners' onslaught. Then besiegers and besieged met
in death earnest combat.</p>

<p>From the ramparts, missiles of all kinds were hurled
upon the heads of those who strove to mount by ladders;
through the breaches cannon shot, rockets, and volleys
of musketry swept scores of the enemy into eternity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Again and again repulsed they still fought their way
onward.</p>

<p>At the part where the attack was directed by an attempt
to scale the walls, the Rani encouraged both men
and women defenders to invincible efforts. Ah God! how
they fought with such inspiration. The ditch below was
filled with the dead and dying. Groans called forth in
return shouts of defiance. She still held the enemy at bay.</p>

<p>Had the assault at other points been as valiantly repulsed,
victory might yet have rested with the besieged;
but in the face of Foreign courage and Foreign bayonets
they were beaten back. Thus the Rani found herself
attacked in rear as well as in front. To defend the streets,
the palace, and the citadel, in turn, went forth as the
last order of the day.</p>

<p>As a consequence each house became a fort, in the
capture of which no quarter was asked or given; every
alley a stubbornly contested battlefield in miniature. The
slain already numbered thousands.</p>

<p>At last the Foreigners fought their way to the vicinity
of the palace, when, to their dismay, flames burst forth
on either side throughout the length of the great bazaar.
To retreat became impossible, to capture the palace a
necessity.</p>

<p>They rushed forward across the open space, while a
terrific fire from the guns of the citadel turned full upon
them further decimated their ranks. With a supreme
effort they battered down the doors to find every room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
court, and corridor filled with desperate men, who sought
death by the sword as a certain entry into Paradise. In
the stables fifty Valaitis held out until the sun hid its face
beneath the horizon, though the darkened heavens continued
to reflect the angry glow of the burning city.</p>

<p>From the summit of the fortress, the Rani's banner still
fluttered in the breeze. By force she had been carried
into the citadel.</p>

<p>Her determination had been to perish on the steps of
her throne. In the great hall, surrounded by her bodyguard,
she stood to hurl a last defiance at her enemies,
still unconquered, still resolute, in spite of the horrors
she had witnessed. Every moment the din and tumult
increased as the Foreigners fought their way to her position.
While bronzed sinewy hands grasped their weapons,
hers sought the dagger of her lover, lying near her heart.</p>

<p>From a side entrance Ahmad Khan, a dishevelled, conflict-stained
object, rushed in, and without seeking her
command, grasped her tightly by the arm. Her protest
he heeded not, but drew her quickly to a door behind
the throne, that opened into a narrow passage leading
into the interior of the fortress. The guards closed in
on her steps and swept her onward. In a few minutes
she was in a place of temporary safety.</p>

<p>Thus night fell as a curtain to veil the scene of
carnage.</p>

<p>Within a bare, stone walled room, the Rani had lain
down upon a pile of mats, worn out with her exertions.
On the floor near by a lamp cast a flickering light upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
her features, that still displayed no sign of yielding. Food
had been brought to her side by rough, though loving
hands; but little of it had been partaken. For the hour,
the silence of the visitation of death had succeeded the
air-filled tumult of battle.</p>

<p>Presently the Rani turned her face to an officer standing
near the door, and asked if Ahmad Khan was within
call.</p>

<p>"He has been speaking with someone," the officer replied,
"and now cometh this way."</p>

<p>In a moment Ahmad and a soldier entered the room.</p>

<p>"Good Ahmad," she asked. "How long dost think
we can hold the citadel"?</p>

<p>"Noble Lady," he replied in a doubtful voice. "I fear
not more than two or three days at most. The ammunition
is well nigh exhausted; food and water are in scarce
quantities. But this good fellow," he added, referring to
the soldier, "brings a message from the foot of the
rock, that a plan has been effected for your Highness's
escape."</p>

<p>"Escape," the Rani cried contemptuously. "Hast thou
not heard me vow a hundred times that I would perish
with my people"?</p>

<p>"Aye," Ahmad acquiesced. "But, noble Rani," he
urged, "I beg thou wilt listen to the best advice. Thy
life and not thy death is of most advantage to the cause,
bravely as all know thou wouldst yield the former. Tantia
Topi now moves on Kalpi. Thy presence there is
sorely needed. Below the rock, fathered in the shadow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
are three hundred of thy remaining Valaiti troopers, together
with a captain's escort from the force of Tantia
Topi. The spot may be gained with a rope, and then
fear not but that they will cut for thee a passage through
a host of enemies. I do beg of thee not to hesitate a
moment."</p>

<p>The Rani considered for a little, when it appeared as
if she was about to fall in with his suggestion.</p>

<p>"But what will happen to these brave fellows, seemingly
deserted in their hour of need"? she asked. "Does
it not seem a craven act to abandon them to their fate"?</p>

<p>"Nay, brave Lady," Ahmad reasoned. "In thy flight
lies the only safety for their lives. As long as thou art
among them they will fight to the death; but when thou
art gone they will surrender, and the Foreigners will
show them mercy."</p>

<p>His argument evidently impressed the Rani favorably.</p>

<p>"True," she replied, "it would be a useless sacrifice.
Besides, I may be able to persuade Tantia Topi to return
to fight again for Jhansi. Are these troopers now
in waiting"? she asked.</p>

<p>"In all anxiety for thy safety," he answered. "I do
beg of thee not to lose a moment, for now that all the
Foreigners are within the city there is little danger in
thy path of flight. By daybreak it may be too late."</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment, then rose with her mind determined
on the act. She drew a shawl over her face and
shoulders as much to conceal her features as a protection
from the night air.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lead quickly to the place," she enjoined, "or the
sight of my brave soldiers may bring about a change of
mind. I will bid them no farewell. I cannot, I dare not
do so."</p>

<p>Through the darkness Ahmad conducted her rapidly
to a part of the citadel wall, from which the descent to
the plain though steep and hazardous was yet possible
with the aid of a rope.</p>

<p>Without permitting her time for reflection, Ahmad secured
one end of the rope under his arm pits, and holding
her round the waist, swung down from the parapet. A
soldier above slowly paid out the rope as Ahmad directed
by prearranged signals. More than once it strained
and quivered with their weight, several times his feet
slid from the ledges of rock upon which they momentarily
rested. Above their heads the fortress loomed a huge
black mass; below their feet there fell away an impenetrable
abyss. The well-feigned cry of a night bird announced
to those below that the fugitives had left the
fortress. In response, there rose the howl of a jackal.</p>

<p>Presently, it seemed an hour had passed, a familiar
voice fell upon the Rani's ears. There was no time permitted
to ask its owner's name, for a pair of stout arms
relieved Ahmad of his burden, and she found herself
placed on the saddle of a horse.</p>

<p>Ahmad quickly disengaged himself from the rope and
sprang on to another waiting mount, the cry of the jackal
again rose as a signal that the feat had been safely accomplished,
and thus shielded by the swords of her devoted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
troopers, the Rani commenced the second stage of
her escape.</p>

<p>On the morrow, the citadel surrendered to terms; and
the blind beggar crept forth from his hiding place to resume
his seat in the shade by the palace doors.</p>

<h2>Chapter XVIII<br />

<i>A PRINCE IN SCARLET</i></h2>


<p>With caution, the troopers encircling the
Rani, felt their way out from the shadow
of the rock. Then with loosened reins
they rode, as with the speed of a monsoon
wind, northward to the rendezvous of the Native forces
at Kalpi.</p>

<p>At first, they avoided the main road and, with unslackened
pace, took to by-paths that led over ditches and
streams, through dense jungle underbrush, and across
rocky plains, until the danger of an immediate pursuit
was past. Throughout the night the form of the officer
who had taken the Rani from Ahmad's arms kept closely
at her side. That his order must have been to watch over
her as a priceless treasure, was evident from the care he
took to guide her horse at dangerous places, and to
remove from her course an occasional overhanging
branch that might have caused painful if not serious
injury. In the darkness his features were indistinguishable.
Indeed, it seemed as if he purposely kept his face
turned from her; though in the open, the brilliancy of
the starlight shining upon a closely fitting cap of steel,
and arms of ornate workmanship, proclaimed him a cavalier
of rank.</p>

<p>As in the early part of the ride silence was imperative,
the Rani did not attempt to broach a conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
with her companion. In fact, the pace was too swift to
permit even a consecutive flow of thought. Such thoughts
as did occupy her mind were naturally directed to the
reasons she would urge upon Tantia Topi for the immediate
recapture of her beloved city.</p>

<p>Day was breaking when the troopers drew up before
the fortress gates of a friendly raja. The Rani glanced
round to offer her thanks to the officer who had so faithfully
protected her from harm during the long night ride;
but he had disappeared. So also had Ahmad Khan.</p>

<p>Upon seeking the reason for their absence, she was
informed that on striking into the main road, the former
had fallen behind with a small body of men to cover
her retreat, and the latter had been compelled to seek
relief from his fatigue by a short period of rest in the
seclusion of the jungle.</p>

<p>A sudden inspiration prompted her to ask the name of
the gallant captain of the escort. A look of disappointment
crossed her face upon learning that he was a northern
chief attached to the army of Tantia Topi, by name,
Parma Nand Bai Bahadur.</p>

<p>It seemed to the Rani that she had scarcely closed her
eyes in much needed sleep, when a trooper arrived in
haste bearing the waking message that the Foreign cavalry
were in pursuit.</p>

<p>"To the saddle," was the immediate cry. Within a
few minutes she was again flying northward, her escort
reinforced by the presence and body-guard of her recent
host.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Through the trying heat of day, with but momentary
halts for refreshment, she pressed forward over the hundred
and ten miles intervening between Jhansi and Kalpi.
At nightfall a trooper caught up with her party to deliver
the welcome intelligence that the rearguard had
beheld the Foreign cavalry relinquish the pursuit.</p>

<p>Thus she was enabled to rest for the night at a wayside
village without fear of personal danger. Before retiring,
and again on setting forth the next morning she
had looked for the reappearance of the officer who had
so skillfully conducted her retreat; but it seemed he had
turned back upon the heels of the Foreign cavalry to
make certain of their actions.</p>

<p>By easier stages she accomplished the remaining distance
to Kalpi, reaching her destination at sunset to find
that she had outstripped Tantia Topi in his more leisurely
retreat from Jhansi. In the waning light his vanguard
was seen emerging from the ravines by which the city
is approached on three sides. On its fourth, the sacred
waters of the Jumna reflected the deep shadows of a long
line of temples and mausoleums, terminating in the rock
fortress with the <i>ghat</i> at its foot.</p>

<p>The Rao Sahib, who, as the nephew and representative
of the Peshwa, had for several months commanded the
garrison and arsenal at Kalpi, was advised of the Rani's
approach. He sent forward an aide-de-camp to meet her
on the road, and with greetings conduct her to a house
prepared for her reception. He requested that early on
the following morning she would assist at a council-of-war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
to discuss the operations necessary to turn back the
victorious advance of the enemy.</p>

<p>The Rani was concluding her evening meal, when raising
her eyes they rested with surprise upon the form of
her worthy secretary, Bipin Dat.</p>

<p>"Why, good Bipin," she exclaimed in accents of welcome.
"Thou here. I thought thou wert far off discussing
intricate family problems with thy genial uncles."</p>

<p>"Illustrious Lady," Bipin replied gravely. "Such
was undoubtedly my intention when I departed from
your Highness's side in Jhansi; but alas! the pace of those
rascally troopers thou gavest me as an escort, so jolted
my limbs, that on reaching the camp of the invincible
Tantia Topi, I could scarce crawl into his presence. For
days my bones ached to such an extent that a tortoise
would have travelled faster to the abode of my people.
Then when I learned the straits in which your Greatness
was placed, how could I do otherwise than assist in
your relief."</p>

<p>"I see," the Rani exclaimed. "Thy aches and pains
vanished when it became necessary to move faster than a
tortoise, after that feat was so gallantly relinquished."</p>

<p>"Noble Rani," protested Bipin. "Had the great
Tantia Topi only followed the advice of thy humble servant
and been more circumspect in his method of attack,
undoubtedly the Foreigners would all have been eaten up
like grass before a plague of locusts. As it was, with
several other observant fellows, I saw to it that no assault
was contemplated in rear while the battle raged in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
front&mdash;a responsible office, great Lady," he concluded,
self approvingly, "that Tantia Topi admitted had been
well carried out."</p>

<p>"No doubt," acquiesced the Rani, expressing in her
voice the contempt she felt for the conduct of those in
command of the Native army on that critical occasion.
"No doubt, good Bipin. The retreat, they say, was conducted
with masterly judgment. But tell me," she asked
with greater interest. "Hast thou seen aught of Prasad
Singh with the army of Tantia Topi"?</p>

<p>Bipin started at the mention of the Hindu noble's
name.</p>

<p>"Thanks be to God, not I," he exclaimed. "By the
will of the Almighty I trust his spirit has long since
passed into the body of a toad. I have seen naught of
that accursed man."</p>

<p>The Rani's brow darkened for a moment as if Bipin's
expression of sentiment met with her disapproval; but
she spoke again in reference to another matter.</p>

<p>"Good Bipin," she said, "I am glad to see thee once
more, for thou canst render me an immediate service."</p>

<p>He <i>salaamed</i> obediently, while she took a purse from
her girdle and handed him a considerable sum of money.</p>

<p>"Go," she enjoined, "into the bazaar, and without
disclosing who it is that commissions thee, purchase for
me a suit of male attire. I would have thee buy a scarlet
jacket and trousers, a white turban, and red leather shoes
to which spurs may be strapped. Get me also a sword
of the finest tempered steel, and pistols that will shoot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
straight. Remember I care more for the quality of the
weapons than for their ornamentation. Let it be understood
that the sword and pistols will be purchased only
if they meet with my approval. Thou hadst better order
several from which I can make a choice. Go, and do
this speedily, as I have a use for them upon the morrow."</p>

<p>With an expression of surprise on his face Bipin
hesitated, when the Rani, emphatically repeating her
order, he <i>salaamed</i> and departed on his errand.</p>

<p>The sun had risen but a few degrees above the horizon
on the following morning when the Rao Sahib, Tantia
Topi, Ahmad Khan, who had arrived in Kalpi overnight,
and other native leaders, were gathered about a table in
a room of the governor's house, awaiting the Rani of
Jhansi's coming to take a seat at the council.</p>

<p>A curtain screening the doorway of the room was
drawn aside and a young officer entered. With the exception
of his white turban, he was attired in a blood
red uniform from head to foot. It contrasted well with
his dark, handsome features, and admirably displayed his
slender figure. One hand, unusually delicate for a man,
rested upon the butt of a pistol protruding from his girdle,
while the other rose to his turban in a military salute.</p>

<p>The Rao Sahib and Tantia Topi gazed inquiringly as
well as with admiration, upon the newcomer, whom it
was evident they had never seen before. Ahmad Khan
with his back to the stranger's position had failed to remark
his entrance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well officer," the Rao Sahib asked. "Dost bring
us a message from someone"?</p>

<p>The young officer laughed musically as he assumed a
captivating pose.</p>

<p>"I bring you a message, noble Sahibs," he replied, "to
say that the Raja of Jhansi is now present at the council."</p>

<p>"The Raja of Jhansi"? the Rao Sahib and Tantia
Topi both echoed interrogatively, while Ahmad turned
impulsively in his seat.</p>

<p>For a moment the Mohammedan scrutinized the young
officer's features, then gave vent to an exclamation of
surprise.</p>

<p>"By Allah"! he cried, "my Lords, it is the valiant
Rani herself."</p>

<p>The nobles rose from their seats and welcomed her
effusively. For a space the eyes of the Rao Sahib could
discover no other object save her form to gaze upon.</p>

<p>She gracefully moved forward and took a seat at the
board. The cloud of misfortune that had overshadowed
their faces was lifted by her presence. As a ray of
heaven's light to storm-beset travellers she came among
them.</p>

<p>For a time the assembled nobles proceeded to discuss
the events leading up to the numerous reverses they had
recently suffered, those more directly implicated endeavoring
by one plea and another to shirk individual responsibility.
In this useless wrangle over past disasters the
Rani's patience soon became exhausted. She perceived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
that unless brought to a speedy termination it might lead,
by way of heated arguments, to the greater disaster of a
feud among themselves. Already Ahmad Khan and
Tantia Topi had exchanged angry words over the generalship
displayed in the battle before Jhansi.</p>

<p>"My Lords," she at this point interposed. "All this
seems to me to add little to the solution of our present
difficulty, except in so far as we may have gathered experience
to bring victory out of defeat. With deference
to your greater knowledge of such matters, in my mind
the most important question, is how to insure a speedy
turn of the campaign in our favor."</p>

<p>"Truly, thou speakest to the point, O Rani," the Rao
Sahib remarked approvingly. "Dost agree then with
Tantia Topi, that we intrench ourselves here in Kalpi and
await the coming of the Foreigners"?</p>

<p>The Rani rose to her feet with a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p>"Noble Rao," she returned vehemently. "That plan
will never do. If it was impossible to hold Jhansi, a
stronger position by a hundred fold than any that might
be afforded by the defenses here, how do you suppose
we could drive away the Foreigners from Kalpi? No,"
she urged, "while I agree that the Kalpi arsenal must
be saved to us at all costs, I believe that the enemy must
first be fought and beaten in the open, at a time and
place the most advantageous to ourselves. To a spot of
our own selection, I would move forward to encounter
them on their way from Jhansi. There, with our troops
well rested and theirs exhausted by a long march, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
chance of victory will rest on our side. Aye, I would
so arrange the hour of battle that we fight in the heat
of noonday, when the sun will aid us as a powerful ally."</p>

<p>"Well spoken, brave Rani," Ahmad Khan applauded
enthusiastically. "Hadst thou learned thy military lessons
from the great Dost Mohammed, thou couldst not
have counseled us more wisely."</p>

<p>"Nay, my lords," she protested, "it is after all but
the opinion of a woman; but if any remain still in
doubt as to the advisability of the plan, give into my
hands the command of this affair and see what comes of
it. If a leader's courage can drive these people back, I
vow they shall never desecrate with their feet the eighty
temples of Kalpi."</p>

<p>The Rao Sahib was enthralled by the beauty and enthusiasm
of the Rani of Jhansi. He would willingly have
granted her request, but that he was fearful of offending
the susceptibilities of his generals. He pondered deeply
before rendering a decision. At last he spoke authoritatively.</p>

<p>"In what the Rani says there is certainly displayed
much good discernment of the situation. I agree with
her that it is better to intercept the Foreigners' advance
than await them here in Kalpi. So if she will accept the
leadership of the cavalry under the supreme command of
Tantia Topi, I believe Kalpi may be saved."</p>

<p>"Noble Rao Sahib," the Rani returned. "Most readily
will I accept any office which you may be pleased to give
into my hands. But I would urge that we set out forthwith,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
in order that we may have time to select a good
position. Be assured the Foreigners will not rest while
another prize remains to fall into their hands."</p>

<p>"Thou art right, noble Rani," the Rao Sahib acquiesced.
Then turning to Tantia Topi he asked if any place suggested
itself to his mind as the best vantage ground on
which to meet the enemy.</p>

<p>Tantia Topi called for a map of the country, and for
several minutes studied it carefully. At last he gave it
as his opinion that at Kunch, forty miles distant, the nature
of the country would afford the best strategic position
for a decisive battle.</p>

<p>"It is a good place," he explained, "because lying
half way on the road to Jhansi, if the rout of the Foreigners
be complete, a flying column may push swiftly on to
the Rani's capital, with a chance of surprising and capturing
the weak garrison that the Foreign general can only
afford to leave there."</p>

<p>"Good, most sagacious Tantia Topi," the Rani exclaimed
approvingly. Then turning to the Rao Sahib
she earnestly besought of him a favor.</p>

<p>"My Lord," she said, "thou wilt not deny me the
command of any force detached for the recapture of my
own city"?</p>

<p>The Rao Sahib replied with gallantry.</p>

<p>"Assuredly that thou shalt possess, fair cavalier.
Tantia Topi now hath my orders to give that command
to no one else."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"So to Kunch, my Lords," he added, "is our final
decision."</p>

<p>"Aye and to victory, forget not that," the Rani cried
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>The council then proceeded with a discussion of the
details of the expedition, to rise, at last, confident that
with the greater number of men and guns they could
put into the field, together with natural advantages on
their side, the result of the battle could not be otherwise
than a victory for the Native arms.</p>

<h2>Chapter XIX<br />

<i>A CALL TO THE HEART</i></h2>


<p>Near the decaying town of Kunch the Native
army had taken up a strong position. In the
shelter of woods and gardens, interspersed
here and there with temples, for the time being
occupied as miniature forts, the whole was fronted
by a high wall over which a row of cannon peered their
sinister muzzles.</p>

<p>For several days the retainers of numerous petty
rajas, driven back upon the main body by the advance
of the enemy, had been arriving to reinforce those who
confidently believed they were about to deliver a death
blow to the Foreigners. The plan of battle had been
skillfully arranged. Under the supreme direction of
Tantia Topi, Ahmad Khan had been given the command
of the artillery, the Rani of Jhansi the cavalry, and
Parma Nand Rai Bahadur, the officer who had rescued
the Rani from Jhansi, and who purposely or otherwise
managed to keep personally out of view, the duty of remaining
in touch with the vanguard of the foe. If the
attack was made at daybreak, the order was to hold the
enemy at bay until the sun had climbed high into the
meridian, and then with the whole force deliver a counter
assault that, in the terrific heat of noon, must take the
enemy at the greatest disadvantage. It was with eager<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
expectancy that both leaders and men of the Native army
awaited the battle that was to crush the power of the
Foreigners in the central provinces of India. All was in
readiness; only one element of doubt as yet remained
undetermined&mdash;that the Foreigners would fall in with the
plans made for their destruction.</p>

<p>It was early on a May morning that scouts brought in
the intelligence that the enemy was in sight of Kunch.</p>

<p>The various arms took up their positions immediately.
On the right, a little in the rear of the infantry, the Rani
of Jhansi galloped to the head of her command and addressed
to her men a few well chosen words of encouragement.</p>

<p>In response they cheered lustily, as they waved their
swords in the bright sunshine.</p>

<p>"We will follow thee to the death, O valiant Rani,"
they shouted enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Of a truth, in both armies, there was on that day no
more gallant or inspiring figure than that of the girl in
the scarlet uniform. From her white turban there rose
and flashed a diamond aigrette, a parting gift of good
fortune from the Rao Sahib, who had remained at Kalpi.
He, too, now regarded himself as an aspirant to her
tender favor.</p>

<p>Thus the men stood to their arms watching a running
skirmish over the plain between their outposts and what
was believed to be the vanguard of the enemy, when a
terrible fusilade of musketry and artillery fire burst upon
their unprotected left flank and rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>The enemy had not fallen in with the plans for their
destruction, but with Occidental perversity had consummated
others of their own. The bulk of the Foreign
army had, overnight, made a wide detour unobserved, and
was now perilously threatening the Native force's line
of retreat&mdash;a movement, that the Foreign general knew
from experience, the Native commanders would be unable
to view with any other feeling than dread. By this action
the battle was won for the Foreigners before it had
even commenced.</p>

<p>Tantia Topi cast a single terrified glance over the field
and fled precipitately; but Ahmad Khan quickly grasped
the situation, in so far as his own branch of the service
was concerned. If he could only bring his guns to bear
upon the force advancing from the unexpected direction,
the Foreigners might be held in check until order was
restored out of the panic that prevailed. The infantry
deserted by their leader had become unmanageable, but
the Rani of Jhansi still held the cavalry together awaiting
orders. To her, Ahmad dispatched an urgent message
begging her to cover his contemplated movement.</p>

<p>She was about to respond promptly, when, glancing
backward she noticed a picket that had been driven in
by the enemy engaged in a desperate encounter with a
larger body of cavalry. In the centre, fighting for his
life with no hope of escape, she beheld the form of the
officer who had succeeded in effecting her deliverance
from Jhansi. The <i>mêlée</i> was too far distant to discern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
his features, but intuitively, without a hesitating doubt,
she knew that Parma Nand Rai Bahadur was one with
Prasad Singh.</p>

<p>Ahmad's request, the peril of the Native army, both
were swept from her mind in the face of her lover's
danger. Without another thought than for his safety,
she gave no order, but impulsively spurred her horse at a
broken part of the intervening wall, and dashed to his
rescue. Her command, not understanding what course
to pursue, divided of their own volition into two parties,
the Valaiti troopers following their mistress, the rest
galloping after the infantry in retreat. Thus Ahmad
Khan, muttering all the curses in his vocabulary, was
left to extricate himself as best he could.</p>

<p>With uplifted sword the Rani came down upon the
Foreign cavalry like an avenging spirit. At last she was
hand to hand with them. Three Native troopers of the
enemy she hurled groaning to the dust. Right and left
she gallantly parried and delivered blows. Her Valaitis
closed about her, as she cut her way toward her lover's
side.</p>

<p>Prasad's horse had fallen. On foot he was fighting
despairingly when her image rose before his eyes,
superbly animated with the ardor of mortal combat.</p>

<p>"Prasad! Prasad!" she cried. "The Rani of Jhansi
cometh to thee."</p>

<p>She raised her sword to parry a blow delivered at his
head, but her hand dropped lifelessly to her side. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
scene became a hazy blur in her vision, reeling in her
saddle she lost consciousness. When she regained her
senses she was far from the battlefield of Kunch.</p>

<p>The victory of the Foreigners had again been complete.
The retreat of the Native army, at first conducted with
order, finally developed into a rout, in which the Valaitis
swiftly bore the Rani back to Kalpi. The Rao Sahib
seized with the same panic that had carried Tantia Topi
from the field to an unknown destination, quickly left
Kalpi to its fate. In the city all was confusion. The infantry
vowed they had been abandoned by the artillery;
the artillery, through the mouth of Ahmad Khan, swore
that the cavalry had deserted them at the critical moment
and thereby lost the battle. Without a leader, the bulk
of the troops were seeking individual safety in the
jungles. They believed the enemy was upon their heels.</p>

<p>Such was the situation to which the Rani opened her
eyes, on recovering from the glancing blow that had
placed her temporarily <i>hors de combat</i>.</p>

<p>Her first thoughts were of Prasad. She inquired
anxiously of those about her if any news of him had
been obtained. The answer was in part satisfactory. He
had been seen during the flight from Kunch, and was
believed to have been ordered to escort Tantia Topi to a
place of safety.</p>

<p>The Rani rose from her couch to view with silent contempt
and outspoken denunciation the craven spirit that
had captured all who remained in Kalpi.</p>

<p>"The Foreigners are upon us," they replied to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
entreaties to make a last stand at Kalpi. "We cannot
fight against them. They will kill all the prisoners. It
is better to fly while there is time."</p>

<p>At this juncture news was brought to the Rani that
the Nawab of Bandah had arrived before Kalpi with a
considerable force. The Rani hastened to his presence,
and besought him in fervent language to save the only
arsenal in their hands. But the Nawab of Bandah had
just suffered a defeat himself. He had trusted to share
in the triumph of the Rao Sahib after Kunch. He certainly
had no stomach to become the hero of a forlorn
hope. Under the circumstances he was much more inclined
to discuss the safest place of retreat.</p>

<p>In despair of being able to induce him to accede to her
purpose, the Rani was forced to summon Ahmad Khan
to her aid, at a moment when the Mohammedan's humor
was deeply offended by her conduct at Kunch.</p>

<p>"Ah," he returned sarcastically. "The brave Rani is
anxious enough to avail herself of Ahmad's services when
it suits her convenience; but when he has fallen into a
ditch, he might summon the moon to his relief with a
surer hope of response."</p>

<p>"Nay, good Ahmad," the Rani replied winningly,
"truly I did not realize thou wert in such distress. I
only saw the desperate need of assistance in which Bai
Bahadur was placed."</p>

<p>"To be sure," he answered tersely. "And who may
be this Bai Bahadur"?</p>

<p>"Thou knowest as much of him as I," the Rani replied.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
"But, good Ahmad," she pleaded, "thou wilt, I
know, support me with this Nawab"?</p>

<p>"Assuredly," he acquiesced in a yielding tone. "Thou
hast a power with us, fair Rani, to gain an end possessed
by no other. Verily, such an obedient hound am I at the
sound of thy voice, that I believe if thou wert to order
me to go forth as a <i>yogi</i> and sit at thy door for the rest
of my days blinking at the sun, the eternal damnation of
the Prophet would not stay my following thy command.
What wouldst thou have me do with this Bandah
Nawab"? he asked.</p>

<p>The Rani explained the Nawab's faintheartedness and
suggested that Ahmad might use a little of the persuasion
so effectual with Sadescheo.</p>

<p>"Aye," he replied twirling his moustaches fiercely.
"But say the word, fair Lady, and for thy sake I will
persuade my hand to cut his head off as the beginning
of my argument."</p>

<p>"Let it be not quite so demonstrative," she enjoined.
"But I would have thee be emphatic none the less."</p>

<p>"The battle yell of thy Valaitis will sound as a love
ditty in his ears afterwards," he returned, and continued.
"Thou art determined then to meet the Foreigners
again"?</p>

<p>"Aye," she replied with spirit, "and to continue meeting
them until I have won a victory or perished in the
attempt."</p>

<p>The result of Ahmad Khan's conference with the Bandah<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
Nawab was a prompt decision to make a last endeavor
to save Kalpi. As a fortress to withstand a siege
it was indefensible, but the ravines and ridges surrounding
the city afforded the best field for intrenched positions.
By day and night, under the supervision of the
Rani and Ahmad Khan, men labored indefatigably
upon these works, momentarily expecting the appearance
of the enemy.</p>

<p>But the Foreigners were completely exhausted by the
difficulties of the long march to Kunch, and the subsequent
battle. It was impossible to follow up the retreat
of the Native army and seize upon Kalpi before discipline
could be restored in the defender's ranks. By
short marches only could they advance further, to find
that the girl whom they had come to regard as the soul
of the rebellion in Central India, was ready to meet them
in a more desperate resistance than ever. The Foreign
general realized speedily that she had rendered her position
well nigh impregnable.</p>

<p>The Rani was not of the temper to await an attack
from behind earthworks, with ever one eye on her line
of retreat. She took the supreme command into her own
hands, and so harassed the Foreigners' advance with her
cavalry, that when they beheld the labyrinth of defenses
raised as if by magic, on the three vulnerable sides of
the town, they did not contemplate a retrograde movement,
but a victory seemed more than doubtful. For
both sides the day of another decisive battle was at hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>In the meantime the Rao Sahib had heard of the successful
efforts of the Rani to bring order out of chaos in
the demoralized condition of the Native army after
Kunch. He returned to reap the reward of a more than
probable victory, and as a consequence the supreme command
again reverted to his hands. At a council of war
before the battle he was not unmindful of escape in case
of defeat.</p>

<p>"We can cross the river and plunge into the jungles
in that event," he remarked. "The Foreigners will not
follow us into those recesses."</p>

<p>Scorn, anger, in a sense despair, were mingled in the
Rani's voice, as with burning cheeks and flashing eyes
she retorted hotly.</p>

<p>"Escape, my lords," she cried, "if we only set as
little store upon escape as do these Foreigners, not one of
them would now remain in India."</p>

<p>She rose abruptly and strode without further utterance
from the council.</p>

<p>"A beautiful woman, a wonderful woman, with an
accursed Afghan lion in leash at her side," remarked the
Nawab of Bandah; "but noble Rao Sahib, thou dost
well nevertheless to look to it, that we are not caught
here in a trap."</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the Native army that sentiment
dominated all their actions. It was the weight that
turned the scale of battle in favor of the Foreigners at
Jhansi, at Kunch, and lastly at Kalpi.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>When the first onslaught came, the Native army repulsed
the Foreigners with desperate valor. The sun
again aided their efforts and decimated the enemy's
ranks as much with blasts of heat as did the storm of shot
and shell, poured forth in a blaze of fire from every ridge
upon which the attack was directed. The odds were too
great against the Foreigners. They wavered.</p>

<p>In a ravine, the Rani held the cavalry in waiting for
such a turning point of the battle. She quickly noticed
the reaction, and with a cheer, caught up by the whole
body of her command, dashed upon the dismayed Foreigners.
For a moment the battle seemed to be won,
but only for a moment.</p>

<p>While she was engaged driving back the frontal attack,
with ruthless slaughter on both sides, the Foreign general
had succeeded in again effecting a flank movement
threatening his enemy's retreat.</p>

<p>The Rao Sahib and the Nawab of Bandah cast a
despairing look across the river to the jungles beyond,
hesitated when they should have led all their forces forward;
a shell burst near them; they turned their horses'
heads and fled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Rani, flushed with victory, was still
driving her opposing force before her, when glancing
backward she beheld with a sinking heart the Native
army in full retreat. A cheer from the Foreigners announced
too plainly that for her, the day was lost.</p>

<p>"The cowards," she muttered, as tears of passionate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
grief coursed down her cheeks. "Oh, the cowards!
Will nothing stimulate their courage"?</p>

<p>With valor born of desperation she hurled herself upon
the enemy still in front and cut her way between their
ranks. Once more surrounded by her faithful Valaitis
she was compelled to fly, on this occasion to the shelter
of the jungle.</p>

<h2>Chapter XX<br />

<i>BIPIN TAKES A PRISONER</i></h2>


<p>When the first messenger from Kunch rode
into Kalpi, as if a thousand demons were
in pursuit, shouting wildly that the day
was lost; the worthy secretary, Bipin Dat,
bitterly reproached himself for not having, at all hazards,
continued his journey to the abode of his family. "<i>Ah,
hae, hae</i>"! he groaned, "what God is unappeased by
which a peaceful man is continually involved in these
affairs of bloodshed. This all comes of not consulting an
astrologer before setting out from Jhansi. He might
have so arranged matters with the heavens, that a whirlwind
would have scattered the Foreigners. Unfortunate
is it, that the great Rani sets so little faith in the all
powerful astrologers."</p>

<p>He quickly gathered a few trinkets together, carefully
secreted them in the folds of his turban, and was among
the earliest to plunge into the jungle.</p>

<p>There, for several days he wandered about in fear of
wild beasts, of robbers, and of evil spirits. In what direction
his footsteps were bent, he had but a faint idea; his
sole aim being to place between himself and the scene of
hostilities the greatest possible distance. An occasional
hut afforded him a sleeping place, where, in the universal
charity displayed to travellers, he was provided gratuitously
with such meagre fare as could be offered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>How far he had wandered, Bipin could make no computation.
The people of the jungle knew only of their
immediate neighborhood. It seemed to him he must
have travelled a great distance. In reality, like many
under similar circumstances, he had been rambling in
circles. At the end of two weeks he was still within
thirty miles of the place he was eager to view from a
distance of two hundred.</p>

<p>The day's tramp had been more than usually a toilsome
one for Bipin. He had taken a narrow path that
seemed to wander capriciously amid tangled underbrush
with no particular destination. The sun had set without
a village or habitation in sight, and the mysterious
silence of the jungle, its ominous shadows, its majestic
gloom, filled his soul with dread. He was reluctant to
go forward, afraid to remain on the spot, and hesitated
to turn back. His terrified fancy beheld the eyes of a
panther or a tiger glaring out at him from behind every
bush. The breaking of a twig, the sound of his own
footsteps startled him nearly out of his senses. Thrice
that day had a fox crossed his path, the worst possible
omen. He beat his breast in his wretchedness. In turn,
his fat cheeks and brow became flushed, and chill as the
damp slab of a tomb.</p>

<p>"Oh, what a fool have I been," he groaned, "to mix
my life up in the intrigues and ambitions of a court.
How much better had I only remained in my humble condition
with my good uncles. I would never have come
to this unlucky pass."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>Before him the path made a bend. Through the
branches he thought he discerned a flickering light. It
might come from a hut, or, he shivered, from the watch
fire of a detachment of the Foreigners. In the morning
he had heard that parties of them were beating the jungle
for fugitives.</p>

<p>But in his deplorable situation, he reasoned, that it
would be better to fall into their hands with the chance
of being able to prove his innocence of rebellion, than
remain where he was, a prey to some malign influence
that, for all he knew to the contrary, might change him
into a bat. He gathered his tattered garments about him,
and moved cautiously toward the light. He had not
taken many steps when a hand stretched out from the
darkness laid a firm grasp upon his shoulder. At the
same moment a voice in his own language gruffly called
on him to halt.</p>

<p>"Who art thou, and whitherward"?</p>

<p>Bipin cast his arms above his head despairingly. His
challenger might be a robber, or the Native sentry of a
Foreign encampment.</p>

<p>"But a poor traveller&mdash;a devotee on his way to the
holy river," he cried timorously, "a man of peace seeking
a shelter for the night."</p>

<p>It was a fortunate inspiration that prompted him to
pose as a pilgrim to the bank of the holy Ganges. The
vilest malefactor would respect the sanctity of his person
undergoing such a pious obligation. Had the idea
only occurred to him before, it would have saved many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
qualms of nervous emotion. The accursed fox would
have fled precipitately at the cry of "<i>Ganga! Ganga</i>"!</p>

<p>To Bipin's relief his captor replied in friendly accents:</p>

<p>"Why, surely, thy voice is not unknown to my ears.
Art thou not one of the Rani of Jhansi's attendants"?</p>

<p>Bipin was about to vow by all his Gods that so far
from being in any sympathy with the Native army, he
detested their actions and loved the Foreigners as his
uncles. For a moment he was tempted to declare, that
never in his life had he beheld the face of the great
Princess, and reassert more firmly his sacred mission;
when it occurred to him that he might have stumbled
upon a detachment of the fleeing Native army. He
promptly decided to make sure of this point before
committing himself to a confounding statement.</p>

<p>"And thy voice, too, I seem to know," he returned.
"Art thou not also one of her followers"?</p>

<p>"A servant of the valiant Rani, herself," came the
terse response.</p>

<p>"Blessed Devi," cried Bipin joyfully. "Am I not her
worthy secretary, Bipin Dat. Tell me, good fellow,
where I may discover her Highness, for whom I have
been vainly searching in the jungle these many days
past."</p>

<p>"That is easily done, holy pilgrim," replied the other,
with a laugh, at the secretary's sudden change of
garment. "She is encamped here with a body of her
Valaitis, in retreat from Kalpi. Come, I will take thee
to her presence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>The sentry led Bipin a short distance to an open space
in which two or three hundred Valaitis were resting with
their horses tethered at hand. Near a small camp fire the
Rani was seated gazing pensively into the smouldering
embers, kept purposely from rising into a blaze for fear
of disclosing her place of concealment. She did not notice
Bipin's approach until he had prostrated himself at
her feet. Then she turned her eyes upon him without
speaking.</p>

<p>"Great Rani," he at last exclaimed. "Behold thy
worthy servant, Bipin Dat."</p>

<p>"Aye," she replied gravely but not unkindly. "Thou
art a strange creature, appearing where least expected.
Better would it have been for thee, good Bipin, if thou
hadst taken another road than that which led to the
Rani's camp. I would urge thee to seek speedily thy
home, for with us henceforth there will be little use for
thy pen."</p>

<p>A note of sadness in her voice appealed to a sympathetic
chord even in the timorous nature of her secretary.
It reproached him with cowardice and infidelity to his
beautiful, heroic mistress.</p>

<p>"Lovely Rani," he cried penitently. "I vow hereafter
I will never leave thy side, come good or evil fortune."</p>

<p>"Bipin," she replied with lighter spirit. "Though the
present hour is dark enough, it may yet be that those who
follow me shall bask in the brightest sunshine. If thou
art determined to be among them, thou hadst better seek
thy rest, for by daybreak we must be far hence."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>A prudent man, the worthy secretary took a careful
survey of the camp before deciding on his sleeping place.
Not that there was much choice as regards a comfortable
position. It was the bare ground for both the Rani and
her attendants; but in his turban there were still hidden
certain articles of value that might tempt the cupidity of
the Valaiti troopers. If in guarding his sleep they despoiled
him of his remaining possessions, he reasoned,
that he would have paid overmuch for a night's security.</p>

<p>In this dilemma, his eyes chanced to observe the well
spreading branches of a tree, under which the Rani had
taken up a reclining position. They suggested to him a
safe retreat. With some difficulty he climbed the lower
trunk and discovered a spot that nature might have constructed
to suit his present need. He curled himself up
where two stout limbs branched off into space, and amid
the shelter of the foliage was soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>The silence of midnight descended on the camp, the fire
died low, an occasional grunt from the throat of a heavy
sleeping trooper on the ground, and a sonorous gurgle
from that of the secretary aloft, were the only noises
distinguishable to the sentries.</p>

<p>Presently the worthy secretary began to dream of the
peaceful abode of his uncles. It was a soothing picture
to his troubled mind, but unfortunately, like the reality
of life, it was not destined to last long without a counterpart
of woe. In that absurdly impossible procedure of
dreams, the accursed barber of Jhansi appeared on the
scene, attired for all the world like a Foreign soldier&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
fact, a horrible nightmare, dual personality, endeavoring
to shave off Bipin's nose and ears with a two handed
sword of immense proportions. In his sleep the secretary
struggled and gasped, for it seemed that the barber-soldier
had seized him by the throat and was endeavoring
to choke the breath out of his lungs. Indeed, the choking
sensation became so terribly realistic, that he awoke
with a wail of anguish to find that it was no dream at all,
but that some huge, black monster, manlike so far as he
could discern its face in the darkness, had grasped him
round the neck, probably with the object of murdering
him for the treasures concealed in his turban.</p>

<p>"Thieves! Murder! The Foreigners"! shouted
Bipin, as loudly as the little wind left in his chest would
permit. He entwined his legs and arms about a furry
body and commenced a struggle for his life.</p>

<p>At Bipin's cry of "The Foreigners," the camp was instantly
aroused. Horses neighed and pawed the earth,
the troopers sprang to their feet, the sentries rushed in
and stood gazing up into the tree from which there came
a medley of strange noises. From the tumult, and the
shower of twigs and leaves that fell upon their upturned
faces, it was evident a desperate conflict was proceeding.</p>

<p>"The Foreigners! Thieves! The accursed Foreigners.
To the rescue, brave Rani; oh! to the rescue, good comrades,"
the voice of Bipin saluted their astonished ears.
Then came screams and chattering in an unknown tongue,
with a fiercer renewal of the unseen combat.</p>

<p>The Rani had been awakened with the rest. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
about to order some of the men to climb up into the tree
and discover the nature of the disturbance, when, with a
crashing of branches, a struggling black mass fell into
their midst.</p>

<p>The troopers started back and then returned to separate
the combatants that still writhed and fought upon
the ground, when the form of Bipin struggled to his
feet. He grasped a hairy baboon by the neck, and held
him a captive before the Rani.</p>

<p>"Ah, what a ruffian," he panted, "to attempt to
strangle me in my sleep. Without doubt he must embody
the spirit of some wicked enemy."</p>

<p>In spite of her overshadowing misfortune, the Rani
could not restrain a laugh at the humor of the situation.</p>

<p>"Thou art a brave fellow," she exclaimed, "and hast
earned thy right to fight with a lance instead of a pen.
Some day, perchance, thou wilt command a troop."</p>

<p>"Truly," reflected Bipin, "whether I like it or no,
Fate will have it that I am to be mixed up continually in
some accursed broil. If not with men, alas! it seems
with the animals. Such is the inscrutable will of God."</p>

<p>The troopers' voices echoed the Rani's sally with
laughter. They drove the baboon from the camp, peace was
restored, slumber once more descended upon their heads.
Before daybreak the party were speeding in a south-westerly
direction toward a rendezvous of the Native
chiefs at Gopalpur.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXI<br />

<i>THE GREAT COUP DE MAIN</i></h2>


<p>It was but a fragment of the army defeated at Kalpi
that had gathered within the insecure walls of
Gopalpur.</p>

<p>Of the leaders, the Rao Sahib and Ahmad Khan
had preceded the Rani of Jhansi to that place. Tantia Topi
and Rai Bahadur or Prasad Singh, were hourly expected.
Upon their arrival a council was summoned to decide
what was best to be done in the hopeless strait to which
the Native cause was reduced. To the North, East, and
South; in whichever direction their gaze turned, they beheld
the victorious Foreign armies closing in upon them
with relentless force.</p>

<p>It was one of those fearful days of heat preceding
every rainy season. The Rao Sahib awaited his companions
under an awning on the roof of his temporary
residence, where any stray breath of wind, however
sultry, would be welcome. The sun had not yet risen
to dispel the haze that enveloped the surrounding jungle.</p>

<p>The Rani of Jhansi arrived first, quickly followed by
Ahmad Khan and other chiefs. Lastly came Tantia Topi
with Prasad Singh.</p>

<p>The nobles saluted the Rao Sahib gravely as they
appeared upon the roof. Prasad's glance rested for a
moment upon the Rani's form, but her gaze was concentrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
upon a map of the country. She was apparently
not aware of his presence. He took his seat the furthest
from her position, after exchanging with Ahmad Khan
a formal greeting.</p>

<p>Since his dismissal from Jhansi, Prasad had come to
regard the Mohammedan's actions leading up to that
event with suspicion. He had formed no definite charge
to prefer against Ahmad, but if they should meet again
he had determined not to place so much confidence in the
other's protestations of friendship. He reasoned that
they had not gone far to assist him in the past.</p>

<p>Toward the Rani, who appeared in his eyes more
beautiful than before, neither time nor absence had diminished
his affection. It was true that while he had come
to regard the act for which his banishment had been
pronounced as inexcusable; the severe, the unjust criticism
upon his private life by one, who, if Ahmad's words
were to be given credence, was herself not blameless, for
long rankled in his breast.</p>

<p>But had Ahmad Khan spoken the truth concerning
her? In the face of the universal praise bestowed upon
her virtue and bravery, a doubt had risen in his mind of
the Mohammedan's good faith. The doubt grew strong
within him during the night ride from Kalpi, and stronger
still after the manner in which she fought her way to his
rescue at the battle of Kunch. If Ahmad had slandered
the Rani's character, had acted as a traitor, he vowed he
would slay him without mercy. But in the meantime she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
had closed his mouth indefinitely. She had laid an interdict
upon any expression of his sentiment. He could not
speak of these things again until such time as she would
grant permission. All he could do was to prove the
depth of his love by such actions as her rescue from
Jhansi. For the rest, he could only hope that fortune
would give him an opportunity to rend the veil of misfortune
that had shrouded his life in Jhansi, and appear
before her in his true character&mdash;a character much tempered
by the trials and hardships he had since experienced.</p>

<p>When all were assembled there ensued a period of
silence. No one among them seemed to find courage in
his heart to speak. Indeed, what was there that could
be said? Their fortresses and arsenals had all been captured;
their armies vanquished and dispersed; the Foreigners
everywhere triumphant. It seemed that only one
topic remained for discussion&mdash;how to escape the vengeance
that would surely fall upon their heads.</p>

<p>The Rani raised her eyes and glanced round upon their
despondent countenances. Upon not one of them could
she detect a spark of hope remaining. They were as
cowed animals awaiting the lash of a master, for offenses
which they knew to be unpardonable, in defeat.</p>

<p>"Well, my Lords," she spoke calmly, "I presume
that being all gathered, our business is to discuss the
next place to give the enemy a battle."</p>

<p>"Give the enemy a battle," Tantia Topi echoed in faint-hearted
accents. "What force of men, what guns, what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
ammunition, do we now possess with which to give battle
to the Foreigners. Where even can we fly, to gain any
but a temporary refuge"?</p>

<p>"That," returned the Rani firmly, "may be the saving
of our situation. We cannot fly, therefore we must
fight."</p>

<p>"Fight," echoed Tantia Topi gloomily. "Have we
not fought already, and what has been the result? Perhaps
the noble Rani," he added, with a strain of sarcasm,
"will instruct us how to wage a war without men or
guns."</p>

<p>Tantia Topi had not escaped the feeling of jealousy
among certain of the leaders, as a result of the praise
lavished by the troops upon the personal valor of the
Rani of Jhansi.</p>

<p>She retorted with rising temper.</p>

<p>"Ah"! she cried. "Have we not had some experience
how fifteen hundred men well-led can give battle to,
and defeat over twenty thousand? Now it is our turn
to win a victory against overwhelming odds."</p>

<p>"Perhaps the valiant Rani will instruct us further,"
the Native general suggested, controlling his anger with
difficulty, at the Rani's reference to his Jhansi defeat.</p>

<p>The Rao Sahib interposed, fearful of an altercation between
his two most skillful commanders.</p>

<p>"Assuredly, fair Lady," he said, "any suggestion for
a way to retrieve our disasters will be most welcome."</p>

<p>"Then, my Lords," she continued, as if suggesting a
plan that presented little difficulty of accomplishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
"it is simply, that either by strategy, diplomacy, or assault,
we do capture Gwalior."</p>

<p>"Gwalior! Gwalior"! passed from mouth to mouth,
while looks of incredulous amazement broke upon all
faces.</p>

<p>"Gwalior, noble Rani," repeated the Rao Sahib.
"Surely thou must mean some other place, not Maharaja
Sindhia's impregnable stronghold, garrisoned by twenty
thousand Foreign drilled troops."</p>

<p>The Rani rose to her feet and spoke with gathering
animation.</p>

<p>"Aye, noble Rao Sahib, I do mean Gwalior, Maharaja
Sindhia's capital and no other. I beg your patience," she
proceeded, "while I disclose my plan further. With us
here, we have, or may gather together on the march, perhaps
eight thousand troops&mdash;a force with which much
may be accomplished, as Tantia Topi knows."</p>

<p>She glanced at the Native hero of numerous defeats
with a slight expression of contempt about her lips, and
continued:</p>

<p>"Good, then, with these I propose that we make forced
marches immediately upon Gwalior, and arrive there before
Sindhia has been warned of the coming of his guests.
It is well known, my Lords, that Maharaja Sindhia is, at
heart, in sympathy with our cause. It is also well known,"
she added with exquisite naïvete, "that he is a young
man not insensible to the charms of a fair woman. To
Sindhia, then, I purpose to dispatch a messenger beseeching
him to grant me an interview. If he doth grant it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
be assured there will be no battle before Gwalior. He
will join us with all his forces. But if his crafty minister,
Dinkar Rao, or his Foreign councilor, doth persuade
him that the Rani of Jhansi's eyes will bewitch his reason
to perdition, and he doth refuse my emissary; then we
will take his capital whether he be disposed to yield or
no. His people are our people; his troops our troops;
discreet messengers may induce many to join us at the
critical moment, if he elects to give us battle. Gwalior
captured," she cried with flashing eyes, "and all Northern
India lies at our feet. The Foreigners cannot march
upon us immediately, for the rains will make the roads
impassable. Thousands will rally to our side. Our
swords will again flash across the heavens. Who knows
not only Jhansi, but Delhi may be recaptured. Is not
this a prize worth staking our frail lives upon? But
even if defeat is again the will of God, if die we must;
is it not better to perish as warriors should, in a feat of
arms upon which the eyes of our enemies will gaze with
marvel, than as wild beasts hunted through the jungle?</p>

<p>"Ah, my Lords," she appealed to them with superb
emotional fervor. "Let not us cherish despair, but take
to our hearts that invincible faith in ourselves, by which
the seemingly impossible is often successfully accomplished.
Now is the hour when the steel of our courage
is forever determined. Let us at least drag from the unwilling
tongues of these Foreigners the admission, that
the glorious traditions of our race are not to be closed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the pages of history, without reference to a sublime, a
mighty funeral."</p>

<p>The Rani's hearers gazed upon her in wonder. That
the force of her argument; the fire of her words, swept
toward them as a blast from a furnace of heroism, had
kindled in their breasts a responsive flame of her own
dauntless spirit, was evident: but they were appalled,
dumbfounded at the audacity, the daring of her proposal.</p>

<p>To march upon Gwalior in the demoralized condition
of their army, in their own sickening despair. Gwalior
protected by the strongest fortress in all India, that was
regarded, even by Sindhia's Foreign allies as impregnable.
Gwalior the capital of the great Maharaja, containing the
pick of the Native army and vast stores of munitions of
war. No! It could not be done, they agreed mentally.
The plan to their minds did not offer the single chance
out of a thousand in a forlorn hope.</p>

<p>The Rao Sahib sighed deeply. He gravely shook his
head from side to side.</p>

<p>"It is impossible, I fear, brave Rani," he replied. "It
would be easier to recapture Delhi, than seize Gwalior
from Sindhia's hands."</p>

<p>"Impossible! Impossible"! the others echoed sadly.</p>

<p>Even the fierce nature of Ahmad Khan for once failed
to respond to an enterprise of such overpowering odds.
But in his mind, the reappearance of his rival, had
inflamed his jealousy and hatred to subvert all other
feelings. His eyes, at intervals, had glanced suspiciously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
from the Rani to her lover. Though he had detected
no signs of affectionate regard pass from one to
the other, he knew that between himself and Prasad, her
heart in its entirety, if not her favor, went forth to the
noble of her own faith.</p>

<p>Despair, not of an ultimate triumph over the enemy,
nor as the result of the blood-stained conscience which
certain among the Foreigners asserted she possessed,
but despair of her ability to move her companions
to one of those splendid achievements of warfare,
by which campaigns are turned suddenly in favor of the
vanquished, seized upon her spirit. It stimulated all the
heroism of her nature to an outburst of feeling. She
could no longer withhold the whip of scorn to thrash
their courage into action.</p>

<p>"Then stay, my Lords," she cried, "and rest yourselves
in Gopalpur. The weather is hot and uncomfortable,
for such work as this of Gwalior. But I&mdash;I with
my Valaitis, even if not another one doth follow, will
go to Sindhia's fortress, and either bid defiance to the
Foreigners from its walls, or yield my life into the hands
of God."</p>

<p>Ahmad's martial spirit was stung by the taunt. He
would have risen to his feet in support of the heroic
woman, had not a quicker action on Prasad's part restrained
him, in sullen humor, to his seat.</p>

<p>The Rani had turned as if about to leave the council,
when Prasad crossed over to her side. He drew his
sword and laid it at her feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>"If no other will follow," he cried, "I will go with
thee to Gwalior, or to wherever thou dost lead."</p>

<p>The Rani rewarded him with a grateful look, in which
he might have discerned the shade of a more tender feeling.
She bent down, and taking his sword gave it back
to him.</p>

<p>"Thou shalt go with me to Gwalior," she spoke gently.</p>

<p>The Rao Sahib had listened throughout the Rani's appeal
with a growing appreciation of its truth. Some
great, some telling stroke must be delivered in the emergency.
It needed but an incident like Prasad's act to win
him over to her side.</p>

<p>"Aye," he exclaimed. "Prasad Singh doth rightly.
We will all go with thee, valiant Rani. The command,
too, of this business shall be given to thy hands. If
Gwalior is captured, the glory of it shall forever rest upon
thy head."</p>

<p>The Rani was quick to encourage with praise the turn
of opinion in her favor.</p>

<p>"Now do I know, as I had ever believed," she cried
joyfully, "that thou art all brave men. Within a week,
I vow the Peshwa shall be proclaimed in Sindhia's
palace.</p>

<p>"And so," she added, "that we are no longer divided
in this matter, I would select the one to go forward as
my emissary to Sindhia. Ahmad's valor would entitle
him to the dangerous mission, but that, without offense
to any present, it would be better to dispatch a Hindu
noble as an envoy to a Hindu prince. Otherwise the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
Maharaja may regard our aim as too much in the interest
of the court of Delhi. Thus I would urge that
Prasad Singh doth set forth immediately on this errand,
while we close in upon his steps to-night."</p>

<p>"I have said thy will shall be the order of our march,
brave Rani," returned the Rao Sahib. "Prasad Singh
will go as thy messenger to the Maharaja forthwith."</p>

<p>The Rani turned toward her lover.</p>

<p>"Go then, good Prasad," she enjoined, "and in thy
most skillful manner seek to obtain for me an audience
with Sindhia, at some place without the walls of Gwalior
secure from treachery. Go, and may God's blessing rest
upon thy head.</p>

<p>"So, my Lords," she cried. "Let us to Gwalior with
cautious speed, and good fortune smiling on our efforts."</p>

<p>The nobles rose spontaneously and shouted with rekindled
spirits:</p>

<p>"To Gwalior! To Gwalior "!</p>

<p>The cry was caught up by the soldiers on guard in the
compound:</p>

<p>"To Gwalior! To Gwalior! Death to the enemy.
Victory for the Rani of Jhansi."</p>

<h2>Chapter XXII<br />

<i>VICTORY</i></h2>


<p>From remote ages Gwalior had been one of the
chief cities of India, owing to the immense
natural strength of its position. Many races,
succeeding one another, had reared their dwellings
about the foot of the huge pile of rock, rising in
grim, deep shadowed precipices on all sides, two to three
hundred feet from a broken plain, to a plateau crowned
by the massive fortress, a mile and a half in length by
three hundred yards wide. By a single narrow path alone
could the summit be gained.</p>

<p>Numerous had been the splendid palaces, temples, and
mausoleums erected in the vicinity by dynasties swept
away, and ruins only of the Baradari, once the most
superb hall of audience in the world, marks the site of
the colossal residence of the Moguls.</p>

<p>In part skirting the suburbs of the city, the Morar
river winds northward to its junction with the Chambal,
thence its waters reach the Jumna, to mingle finally with
those of the holy Granges. Beyond the Morar, at a considerable
distance rocky hills bordering the plain, afford
a first line of defense, the few defiles being easily rendered
impassable by fortified works.</p>

<p>Such was the place the Rani of Jhansi's daring spirit
had determined to seize. It was rich in long accumulated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
treasure to refill an empty purse, rich in the heirlooms of
one of the greatest Native families, and in war material to
arm new levies of troops, and thus prolong the strife to an
indefinite period. As a prize to fall into her hands, there
was scarcely its equal at the moment in India. The moral
effect of the successful accomplishment of the act, upon
both parties to the struggle, would almost equal that of
the capture of Delhi at the commencement of hostilities.</p>

<p>On the morning of the Thirtieth of May, Maharaja
Jaiaji Rao Sindhia, the ruling prince of the great Maratha
house of Gwalior, had finished his devotions and was
about to partake of his usual frugal early meal of milk,
bread, and fruit, when a servant delivered a surprising,
and, on the whole, an unwelcome piece of news.</p>

<p>An emissary of the Rani of Jhansi had arrived at the
palace, and requested an immediate audience with his
Highness.</p>

<p>During the year past, Sindhia had heard much of the
redoutable Princess of Jhansi. He had been told of her
beauty, her wisdom, and her valor. He had followed
with sympathetic interest the capable administration of
the government of her state, her defense of Jhansi, and
latterly, with secret regret, the misfortunes which had
descended on her head. So much for his private feeling
toward the Rani.</p>

<p>But in public he had followed the advice of his astute
minister, Dinkar Rao, who persuaded him to remain an
ally of the Foreigners, against his natural impulse to cast
in his lot with the Native cause. This, for a sufficient, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
not a patriotic reason. While Sindhia bore no love for
the Foreigners, he experienced less for the Peshwa as
the supreme head of the Marathas, and less still, if not
actual hatred, for the ruling Mohammedan family of
Delhi.</p>

<p>"If," argued Dinkar Rao, "the Foreigners are driven
out of India, who will grasp the great scepter? Surely
either the Peshwa or the Emperor of Delhi. What then
will become of Maharaja Sindhia? He will be, as of old,
a feudatory of an avaricious Native monarch. Better is it
to submit to the lesser evil, the comparatively light yoke
of the Foreigners."</p>

<p>Maharaja Sindhia perceived the wisdom of his minister's
argument, and in spite of the execrations of his
troops and people, remained the Foreigners' faithful ally,
when his influence cast into the scale on the other side,
might have ended their rule in India.</p>

<p>His first thought on hearing of the arrival of the Rani's
messenger, was that she was about to look to him for an
asylum of refuge. Under the circumstances he devoutly
wished she would seek the protection of some other prince.
Her presence in Gwalior would surely again stir up his
people, many of whom, without his permission, had joined
the ranks of the Native army. Then if he were compelled
to hand her over to the Foreigners, the act would be so
unpopular, that it might be unsafe for him to remain in
his own state. He reasoned thus, while he sent in haste
for his minister to take advice before consenting to receive
the Rani's envoy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>Dinkar Rao was as much perturbed as his master over
the intelligence. He hastened to Sindhia, resolved to urge
a refusal of the Rani's petition whatever might be its import.
He, too, arrived at the hasty conclusion that she
was desirous of seeking a refuge in Gwalior. It would,
he reasoned with the unscrupulous nature of a born diplomat,
have laid the Foreigners under a lasting debt of
gratitude, if she could be tricked by fair promises to place
herself in Sindhia's power, and then handed over to the
mercy of her enemies. But he feared the vengeance of
the people, who regarded her as the champion of a
righteous cause. At all costs the Rani of Jhansi must be
kept away from Gwalior.</p>

<p>These sentiments he strenuously urged upon Sindhia,
before it was decided to accord the interview.</p>

<p>Prasad Singh entered Sindhia's presence as became the
emissary of a great princess. He saluted the Maharaja
with dignified respect, and then proceeded to unfold his
mission.</p>

<p>The Rani of Jhansi, he announced, with other illustrious
princes and generals, and an army of eight thousand
men, were now encamped at Bahadurpur nine miles
distant.</p>

<p>Both Sindhia and Dinkar Rao started. This was not
the usual way a fugitive sought protection. They at once
perceived a greater peril in the situation than they had
imagined. Not that they feared for Gwalior itself as a
fortress, but concerning the people. Could they depend
upon the fidelity of their troops in such an emergency?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
Against any other leader, probably; but the name of the
Rani of Jhansi made it more than doubtful. In the temples
prayers were constantly rising for her safety.</p>

<p>Sindhia replied to the envoy, by asking the purpose of
the Rani of Jhansi at the head of so large a force within
his territory.</p>

<p>"Her Highness," Prasad returned evasively, "is but
marching from Gopalpur to the north, and has halted to
pay her respects to the great Maharaja of Gwalior. She
is desirous of a personal interview with a prince of whom
she has heard so many words of praise."</p>

<p>Sindhia's feelings were stirred conflictingly. He
would have sacrificed much personally to behold the woman,
of whom all men spoke in such enthusiastic terms.
He would have been glad to receive her with the highest
honors; but the shadows of the Peshwa, the Emperor,
and the Foreigners haunted his mind.</p>

<p>"Doth the Rani then desire to enter Gwalior"? he
asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Such, my Lord Sindhia," Prasad replied, "is far
from her Highness's present intention. She trusts to
meet the great ruler of Gwalior merely in friendly intercourse
at some point without the city. To this end only
do my instructions extend."</p>

<p>Sindhia found himself in a dilemma. To refuse this
apparently simple request might seem an ungracious act.
Besides, he was anxious to judge of the beauty and charm
of which others raved continually. Surely there could
be little harm in extending to her this outward mark of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
his respect. If the Foreigners blamed him subsequently,
he could plead the danger of the situation. He might
even assert that his object was to urge upon her to
surrender.</p>

<p>But Dinkar Rao was of a different mind. His master's
<i>zanana</i>, tenanted by more than one beauty, was a
conspicuous proof of the youthful Maharaja's susceptibility
to the charms of fair women. Whatever covert
object the Rani might have in view, and from her character
he suspected an ulterior design cloaked by the harmless
nature of her request, he feared that Sindhia would
be carried away by her smile if not by her force of argument.
So he took upon himself to reply by a pointed
question.</p>

<p>"Thus far, well, my Lord Prasad Singh, but the
Maharaja Sindhia should be informed first, how it comes
about that the Rani of Jhansi prefers her request with
an armed force so near to Gwalior, instead of sending
forth her envoy from the boundary of the state, asking
permission to approach the capital. To my mind it does
not display great respect on her part for the authority
of Maharaja Sindhia."</p>

<p>The concluding statement was directed as much to the
sensibility of his master as it was by way of reply to the
Rani's envoy. It had the designed effect. Sindhia's
pride was nettled.</p>

<p>"Aye," he acquiesced. "My minister speaks wisely.
Doth the Rani of Jhansi suppose my territory is to be invaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
at the will of any neighboring ruler? That question
must be answered to our satisfaction."</p>

<p>"My Lord Maharaja," Prasad replied. "I have no
doubt the Rani will, herself, make her action excusable
to your Highness. We live in times of strife when the
customs of peace are swept aside out of necessity. Your
Highness, as a great Indian prince, will surely not view
with disfavor the Rani's conduct in defending her rights
against the Foreigners."</p>

<p>The appeal touched Sindhia's heart. Before his mind
rose the image of the valiant Princess, fighting for her
throne, their united country and religion. He hesitated
to return an answer. It was a critical moment for the
fortunes of his house.</p>

<p>Dinkar Rao quickly perceived the effect of the sympathetic
chord touched by the envoy. He seized the opportunity
to impress upon his master's ears a discordant
note.</p>

<p>"Of the misfortunes of the Rani of Jhansi," he said,
"Maharaja Sindhia cannot be unmindful, but," he added
with significance, "among her allies are representatives
of the Peshwa and the Emperor. These are no friends
of Sindhia. Rather are they more his enemies than the
Foreigners. It is my advice that the Maharaja does not
meet the Rani with these people. It is my advice that he
doth require the Rani to immediately withdraw from his
dominions."</p>

<p>"Aye, thou speakest well, Dinkar Rao," remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
Sindhia. "The Rao Sahib has no right to come with
armed men into my territory."</p>

<p>Prasad was not prepared for this trend of argument.
He again besought Sindhia to grant the Rani her request;
but Dinkar Rao's policy prevailed. Sindhia would not
receive her in such company as that of the Rao Sahib
and Ahmad Khan. She must retreat beyond his borders
forthwith, or abide the consequences. Such was his ultimate
decision. He was probably glad to be afforded
so plausible an excuse for refusing hospitality to the
Foreigners' enemy.</p>

<p>Thus Prasad was reluctantly obliged to return to the
Rani's camp with the information that his mission had
failed.</p>

<p>"So Dinkar Rao," the Rani cried, "is fearful that I
might win his master to our cause. We will then take
his capital."</p>

<p>On the First of June the sun rose to discover the armies
of the Rani of Jhansi and Maharaja Sindhia confronting
each other on the plain of Gwalior. In the distance the
great rock with its fortifications stood out defiantly against
the sky.</p>

<p>Overnight, Sindhia had been informed that the Rani's
forces, so far from obeying his injunction to retire from
his state, were advancing upon the city. It left him no
alternative but to give battle.</p>

<p>Sindhia had occupied a strategic position on rising
ground, his flanks protected by squadrons of cavalry, his
center formed by artillery. A splendid body of six hundred
nobles and retainers guarded the person of the
Maharaja.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 611px;">
<img src="images/i255.jpg" width="611" height="900" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Her horse leaped forward, straight for Sindhia's guns.&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_255">255</a>.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Across the plain, the Rani had thrown out a light
screening force of skirmishers. Behind these she had
placed herself at the head of her Valaitis, with Prasad
bearing her standard once more proudly aloft. Again
in rear was her artillery and infantry, with the remainder
of her cavalry under Ahmad Khan in reserve, either to
support her in case of need, or to dash for Gwalior the
moment the day was won.</p>

<p>The Rani wore on her head a Persian cap of steel,
richly ornamented with figures of beaten gold, a spike of
the same precious metal, and feathery aigrettes. Her
hands and wrists were protected by gauntlets of metal
scale work. It was evident she did not intend to direct
the battle from a spot secure from the danger of shot or
blows. Every inch did she appear as one of those intrepid
Maratha warriors, who had defied the power of the
great Mogul, in order to carve kingdoms and principalities
for themselves out of his empire.</p>

<p>Presently Sindhia's guns opened on the advancing foe.
They swept the open space between the two armies with
devastating force, driving the Rani's skirmishers back
upon the main body. For a few minutes the smoke hid
the two forces from each other. It was the moment the
Rani looked for to deliver a telling blow.</p>

<p>She turned in her saddle and raised her sword. A
bugle rang out the clear notes of the charge. Her horse
leaped forward straight for Sindhia's guns, with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
troopers thundering in her wake. Onward she dashed
heedless, and unharmed by the shot and shell, up to the
wall of smoke, and through it to the belches of cannon
flame. With a terrific yell her troopers came upon the
gunners, driving them from their posts. Sindhia's first
line broke and fled. The Rani had captured his guns.</p>

<p>Sindhia's glance swept over the field in alarm. He
had ordered his infantry to support the artillery and they
had refused to obey. If his ears did not deceive him,
they were shouting the Rani of Jhansi's name. A decisive
moment had come. Something must be done or
the battle was lost. He ordered his bodyguard to charge
before the Rani's troopers could reform or she could
receive support.</p>

<p>The Rani accepted the challenge, rallied her troopers
as best she could, and boldly fronted the oncoming force.
The shock was terrific, the ensuing <i>mêlée</i> of cursing,
shouting, fighting horsemen, desperate. In the heart of
it all the Rani's sword flashed above her head, delivering
sweeping blows. Wherever her standard, slashed and
pierced with sabre cuts and bullets, waved, there the fight
seemed hottest. Her life appeared to be shielded by a
charm. At one time she had cut her way near to Sindhia's
person.</p>

<p>"Sindhia! Sindhia"! she cried. "Art thou as much
afraid of the Rani's sword as thou art of her eyes. Stay
but a moment, as I would exchange a few strokes with
thee."</p>

<p>But Sindhia had seen enough of the day. The ferocious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
Valaitis were routing his bodyguard, his infantry
had gone over to the enemy, the Rani's main force was
advancing to cut off his retreat. In the distance he beheld
the enemy's reserve cavalry sweeping across the
plain to seize his capital. With a few horsemen, he turned
and galloped from the field to his Foreign allies at Agra.</p>

<p>A great victory had at last crowned the Rani's arms,
the battle of Bahadurpur was won; she had kept her
promise, Gwalior lay at her feet.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXIII<br />

<i>HAIL! PRINCESS of the MARATHAS</i></h2>


<p>Well might the Native leaders give themselves
over to a transport of exultation.
The victory had been so complete, Sindhia's
flight so hasty, that not a rupee of
vast treasure, not a gem of the hoard of a century, had
been saved from their hands. Within an hour they
found their condition changed from being little better
than that of a routed mob, to the possessors of an impregnable
stronghold, a splendid armament of modern
guns, a new force of ten thousand well drilled troops,
stores and munitions of war in abundance. More than
this the people of Gwalior received them, not as conquerors,
but as champions of their race.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon the Rani of Jhansi rode into
Gwalior on the right hand of the Rao Sahib. Thousands
of people came forth to meet her, shouting her name in
a frenzy of joy. As she approached the gates, a salute
of artillery burst from the fortress, high above their
heads. She gazed upward to behold her banner replacing
Sindhia's on the loftiest pinnacle. It was the result
of Prasad's first order, on taking possession of the fortress
in the name of the Rani of Jhansi, as well as that
of the Rao Sahib.</p>

<p>On the steps of the palace they were received by a
group of liberated Maratha nobles, who had been imprisoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
by Sindhia to please his Foreign allies. Their
patriotism had so dominated their discretion that the last
few months had been passed within the walls of the
Gwalior fortress. They greeted their deliverers with
effusions of welcome.</p>

<p>In Sindhia's palace confusion reigned. The chief
ladies of the <i>zanana</i>, his wives and concubines, had heard
from time to time of the exploits of the Rani of Jhansi,
certainly with astonishment. But in the privacy of his
family life, Sindhia had not been so fearful of expressing
his admiration for the heroic woman. Consequently she
found little favor in the minds of the voluptuous companions
of his leisure hours. In the atmosphere of gossip
and jealousy in which they existed, they were inclined to
regard her as a bold creature of less than doubtful virtue,
otherwise she could not consort so openly with men.
Unlike the poor and humble of their sex, who beheld in
her an incarnation of the glorious Uma, the Goddess of
Light and all things beautiful, they ascribed her power
to the influence of the sinister Durga, under whose protection
they charitably asserted she was preserved from
death. Thus she grew in their eyes to be a terrible, awe-inspiring
figure, and they fled from Gwalior faster than
their noble lord, the Maharaja, on the first news that
she was about to enter the city&mdash;&mdash;, white bundles of
humanity, riding for life across the plain, with Ahmad
Khan in vain pursuit. He was loath to be deprived of
the fairest spoil of victory.</p>

<p>It was shortly decided that Sindhia's personal treasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
was to be divided equally among the Native leaders, all
the jewels, silks, and robes found in the <i>zanana</i> to become
the property of the Rani of Jhansi as by natural
right. From the state treasury a bountiful supply of
largess was to be drawn to recompense both their own
troops and those of Sindhia, who had joined them at the
critical moment. A grand <i>Darbar</i> was summoned by
the Rao Sahib to meet that evening in the great hall of
Sindhia's palace, to proclaim the Peshwa supreme Lord
of the Marathas, and to reward the leaders for their
loyalty to the cause.</p>

<p>In the enthusiasm of the hour, all signs of past misfortunes,
or of those which might yet descend, were
swept from the exultant countenances of nobles and officers,
congratulating each other upon the prize that had
been won.</p>

<p>When darkness had fallen, the <i>Darbar</i> hall presented a
scene of unsurpassed magnificence. From huge crystal
chandeliers suspended from the roof, hundreds of candles
illuminated the ornately carved pillars and capitals, the
inlaid pavement, the walls, a blaze of light in the reflections
of silver-framed mirrors. On either side of the
throne gilded chairs of state had been placed, but it was
upon the contents of sundry gold dishes, that the eyes of
the gathering throng feasted.</p>

<p>They were piled high with ornaments scintillating
sparks of colored fire from Sindhia's hoard of emeralds,
rubies, diamonds, and sapphires.</p>

<p>Upon one tray reposed a single jeweled casket, evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
containing some priceless trinket. Several argued
with each other over the question for whom it was destined
as a reward.</p>

<p>Presently, the Rao Sahib entered the hall from a door
near the throne. Toward the figure of the Rani of Jhansi
at his side the attention of all was immediately drawn.
Against her desire to appear in her uniform, she had been
persuaded to attire herself in the state robes of the senior
Rani of Gwalior, silks of many hues, stiff with pearl embroidery.
A splendid crown of rubies and diamonds rose
above her forehead, her girdle was heavy with precious
stones.</p>

<p>The Rao Sahib conducted her to a seat immediately
on the right of the throne, when as the Peshwa's representative
he took a standing position directly in front of
the vacant chair of royal authority. Behind them, and
on either side, the nobles in their train grouped themselves
effectively.</p>

<p>As they looked from the dais they beheld the great hall
filled to its utmost capacity with eager upturned faces.
Curtains screening the apertures had been withdrawn,
disclosing crowded ante-chambers and passages. Could
their gaze have penetrated further they would have seen
a vast concourse surging about the entrance to the palace
and in the courtyard beyond. These did not so much
await the proclamation as another common object in
mind.</p>

<p>The Rao Sahib moved to the edge of the dais, and
read a brief declaration of the Peshwa's titles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>It was received with applause, though it was apparent
their enthusiasm was restrained.</p>

<p>He then proceeded to distribute favors. Upon the
shoulders of the nobles recently imprisoned for their sympathy
with the Native cause, he placed robes of honor.
To others were given important offices and commands.</p>

<p>The recipients were each cheered loudly, but soon looks
of mute inquiry broke on many faces.</p>

<p>Was there then to be no reward for her who had won
all this glory for their arms?</p>

<p>Thus, while Sindhia's jewels were being divided, in the
background, several grew impatient. They began to call
upon the Rani's name.</p>

<p>"Shame! Shame"! they murmured. "Is it not the
Rani of Jhansi who should receive honor above all
others"?</p>

<p>One taller than the rest silenced the complaint for the
moment.</p>

<p>"The casket," said he, "yet remains. Hush! Perchance
it contains the greatest treasure for the Queen."</p>

<p>The jewels were at last disposed of to the satisfaction
of some and the disappointment of others. The Rao
Sahib turned, and took the Rani lightly by the hand. He
led her before the throne.</p>

<p>Then was it that the enthusiasm of every heart burst
forth in a mighty cheer, that shook Sindhia's palace to
its foundations. In the halls, courts, and corridors, it
was tumultuously echoed; the throng without caught it
up, and hurled it above the city to the black walls of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
fortress, where a woman's banner was fluttering in a
gentle current of air.</p>

<p>They knew their valiant Queen was about to receive
her reward.</p>

<p>It was long impossible for the Rao Sahib to obtain a
hearing. The Rani seemed to shrink from the storm of
affectionate regard her rising had called forth. She realized
that she had won a greater victory than Gwalior, the
laurels of which no enemy could snatch from her brow.
She had captured the hearts of the people.</p>

<p>Again and again the Rao Sahib endeavored to enjoin
silence, but it was temporarily obtained in one part only
to be lost afresh in half a dozen quarters. At last he
addressed those nearest to the dais.</p>

<p>"My Lord Rajas," said he, "I need not present to
you the great Lady who stands before the throne. To
the noble Rani of Jhansi belongs all praise for the glory
of this day. As imperishable as the fortress rock of
Gwalior, her name will stand forth in the history of our
race. By the will of the most illustrious Peshwa, I give
to her the supreme command of the army of Gwalior,
and for her adornment Sindhia's most cherished jewels.
For the rest, is she not yours, to honor as you please"?</p>

<p>Prasad had left his place in the suite, and taken the
casket in his hands. He raised the lid and approached
the Rani. Silence fell upon the expectant throng.</p>

<p>With care he took from the casket rope after rope of
matchless pearls. It was Sindhia's state necklace, once
of the Imperial Regalia of Portugal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>He handed the casket to another, and then gently hung
the treasure about the Rani's neck.</p>

<p>Swiftly he stepped back a pace or two. His sword
flashed in mid-air as his voice resounded throughout the
hall.</p>

<p>"Hail! Lachmi Bai, Rani of Jhansi. Hail! Victor
of Gwalior, Princess of the Marathas."</p>

<p>His voice died away for a moment without response,
then the storm of enthusiasm burst forth anew. It grew
into a frenzy almost approaching madness. They
shouted that she should be proclaimed Queen of Gwalior
as well as Jhansi. The Rao Sahib became apprehensive
that she might be swept on the wave of popular favor
even to the dignity of the Peshwa's throne.</p>

<p>Without, the plaudits increased above the tumult in the
hall. An officer with difficulty elbowed his way to the
dais. He delivered a message to the Rao Sahib.</p>

<p>"The people," he cried, "would have the Rani of
Jhansi come forth so that they may behold the light of
her countenance."</p>

<p>The Rao Sahib glanced uneasily over the surging mass
and protested.</p>

<p>"I fear for her person," he said. Then he asked.
"Can they not be appeased in some other way? If thou
wert to scatter money among them."</p>

<p>"Noble Rao Sahib," the officer replied. "A hail of
gold <i>mohrs</i> would not satisfy their humor. They will
see the great Rani, the Victor of Gwalior."</p>

<p>"Aye, my Lord," the Rani interposed. "Surely will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
I go to the steps of the palace. These poor people. Do
I not love them? If it pleases them to see but a frail
being like themselves, their desire is easily gratified."</p>

<p>She took the crown from her head and gave it to an
attendant, replacing it with the folds of a shawl. Then
she moved down amid the cheering soldiers thronging
the hall and passages to the steps of the portico. There
a vast multitude confronted her eyes. Torches flared
upward to illumine exultant faces. Their plaudits were
redoubled as they beheld her come forth attended by the
other leaders of the cause. She moved a few paces in
front of the pillars rising on either side, and stood gazing
wistfully, wonderingly upon the scene. It was to her,
and to her alone, that their admiration, their love went
forth in a whirlwind of vociferous applause; but she
failed to grasp its entire significance. She could have
demanded the Peshwa's crown, and they would have set
it on her head. She received the tribute only as a vindication
of her actions in upholding her rights with the
sword.</p>

<p>It was her hour of triumph.</p>

<p>The scene was less to the liking of the Rao Sahib
even than that within the palace. The Rani of Jhansi
had clearly become the fountain of honor and authority
with the people. Had he understood her nature better
he need not have harbored fear.</p>

<p>Presently those nearest to the portico would have it
that they could gaze upon her face more clearly.</p>

<p>Obediently she threw back the folds of her shawl, disclosing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
all her features to their view&mdash;strength, determination,
heroism, displayed in their classic outlines.</p>

<p>"Ah, dear Rani," a trooper cried. "Beautiful Queen
of Jhansi. Behold how the people do love thee."</p>

<p>The words smote her heart, causing a spring of emotion
to burst forth. On the instant she became the woman
in place of the redoutable warrior. She turned as
if seeking a place of retreat to hide her feelings.</p>

<p>Prasad in waiting near by, noticed her appeal, and
strode to her side.</p>

<p>The Defender of Jhansi, the Victor of Gwalior, raised
her hands to her face, laid her head on his shoulder, and
wept.</p>

<p>Prasad gently led the Rani from the scene. He conducted
her through a silent corridor to a door that opened
into the palace gardens. Thence to a pavilion set apart
for the use of the ladies of Sindhia's <i>zanana</i>. The noise
and uproar died away, the stillness of night fell upon
them, for long neither spoke.</p>

<p>At last the Rani broke the trend of a deep reverie.</p>

<p>"Prasad," she asked. "Art thou not going to the
banquet? See, there are lights yonder in the windows
of the great hall. Thou wilt miss the feast in honor of
our victory."</p>

<p>"What care I for feasts, dear Lady," he returned,
"so that I may stay with thee."</p>

<p>"Thou art changed then, Prasad"? she replied.</p>

<p>"How dost thou mean"? he questioned. "Changed
in some manner I pray God I am; but never was there a
time since I first set eyes upon thy graceful form, when
I hungered for aught else, but thee, fair Rani."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 663px;">

<div class="caption">"Never have I hungered for aught else but thee, fair Rani."&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_267">267</a>.</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! Prasad, surely thy memory is at fault," she
retorted. "I no longer blame thee for it, if truly thou
art changed, but there was a time when thou didst prefer
to drink of Foreign spirits, and enjoy the charms of
<i>natch</i> girls, rather than obey the summons of the
Rani."</p>

<p>"Never," he cried vehemently. "I vow it is not so.
Explain more of this I do beseech thee, so that I may
perceive clearly the source of the untruth."</p>

<p>"I would not recall the matter, only to satisfy thee,"
she answered, "but when thou wert a guest of Ahmad
Khan, dost not remember his enthralling dancer? Ah!
fickle one," she rebuked him lightly. "Has Ganga's
face, too, vanished from thy mind"?</p>

<p>"In truth," Prasad affirmed. "Her face never was in
my mind to vanish from it. With thy dear face ever
before my eyes, I beheld no other, not even as a passing
fancy."</p>

<p>"Say you so"? she spoke quickly. "Yet Ahmad Khan
vowed most reluctantly that thou wert so drunk with
wine, so intoxicated with thy passion for the girl, that
thou couldst not be brought to listen to my voice."</p>

<p>Prasad started, as the late suspicion of his friend's
treachery began to receive confirmation.</p>

<p>"Tell me! Tell me"! he urged. "Did he convey
my message to thee, that I was sick, that I yearned for
a glance from thine eyes to heal my malady"?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>"Truly he did not," the Rani answered. "No such
message did he ever bring."</p>

<p>Prasad sprang to his feet impulsively.</p>

<p>"The lying, treacherous Moslem," he ejaculated
fiercely. "Farewell for a little space, great Rani. For
this he shall answer even at the banquet. I will slay
him in his seat."</p>

<p>"Nay, stay, good Prasad," she enjoined.</p>

<p>"Aye, but thou dost not know all," he returned vehemently.</p>

<p>"But I would know all," she answered calmly, "before
thou dost commit so rash an act."</p>

<p>"Dear Rani! Ah God, that there could be such vileness
coiled like a serpent round any creature's heart.
What wouldst thy order be, if I were to disclose to thee,
that yonder villain, had sworn thy ears were too full of
the love words of another Moslem to hear of my petition,
that his name so hung upon thy lips as to stifle any message
in return, thine eyes so captivated with his form
that thou hadst yielded thy virtue to his passion as readily
as a lotus bending its fair head before a storm? Such
was thy case with Dost Ali; he swore upon his cursed
Koran, and so he stirred my nature until I lost my reason.
What now, great Rani, is thy pleasure, thy command"?</p>

<p>He waited, breathing heavily with emotion, for the
order he anticipated would burst forth from the outraged
woman's lips to exterminate the Mohammedan. But it
did not come.</p>

<p>For a moment, and for a moment only, she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
tempted thus to act. An angry glance swept to the
lighted windows of the banquet hall. But she perceived
the fatal consequences of a blood feud stirred up at that
feast. It might be ruinous to the brightening prospects
of the cause she cherished more than all else.</p>

<p>"Prasad," she replied deliberately. "It is a lie. We
have both been wronged. But as God this day has answered
my prayers, I doubt not he will judge between
us and Ahmad."</p>

<p>"What! Shall I not then go hence and slay him"?
Prasad demanded.</p>

<p>"Nay," she replied restrainingly. "Hast thou forgotten
how we stood in Jhansi? So do we stand here in
Gwalior. All is not yet gained. Be assured the Foreigners
will return. We need Ahmad's sword, more than his
dead body in revenge. Ah! my dear Lord," she exclaimed
with rapture, "Let us forget his wickedness in
this hour of joy&mdash;in this hour of our reconciliation," she
added in a lower tone.</p>

<p>He knelt at her side, then took her yielding form in
his arms. He drew her closer and closer to his breast.</p>

<p>"Prasad! Prasad! I do love thee," she whispered
softly.</p>

<p>"To the end, dear one, to the end," he passionately
returned.</p>

<p>From the banquet hall the sounds of high revelry
came across the garden borne upon air laden with the
perfume of flowers; but, in time, the lights were extinguished,
and only the watchwords of the sentries on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
citadel fell upon their ears. The veil of darkness hid
their long embrace, until the bugles of the morn rang
out the call to arms.</p>

<p>An hour of triumph and an hour of happiness was past;
an hour greater than both was yet to come.</p>

<h2>Chapter XXIV<br />

<i>AHMAD'S LAST STRATAGEM</i></h2>


<p>From the moment of Prasad's reappearance at
Gopalpur Ahmad's jealousy was rekindled to
greater force even than in Jhansi. He hated
the Hindu noble with all the vindictiveness of
his nature. Had stirring events not followed each other
with such rapidity, he would have sought a pretext for
an open quarrel, and once for all settled their rival claims
to the Rani's affection. If he was chagrined at Prasad's
selection to act as her envoy to the Maharaja Sindhia,
the feeling was intensified on the other being chosen as
her standard bearer at Bahadurpur, and by Prasad's telling
stroke for her favor in saluting her as Princess of
the Marathas at the grand <i>Darbar</i>.</p>

<p>At the subsequent banquet he sat in sullen, gloomy
humor. He neither spoke nor feasted. At the call to
drink of spirits and join in the carousal of the assembled
nobles, he pleaded his religious principles as an excuse
to withhold his lips from intoxicating liquors.</p>

<p>That the Rani was not present at the banquet was to
be expected, but he marked Prasad's absence, and drew
conclusions from a guilty conscience. They were together,
he surmised. His duplicity was probably discovered.
"What then"? he again and again asked himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>For the vengeance of Prasad he did not fear. His
arm was as strong as that of his rival. But he dreaded
the form of retribution usually visited at Native courts
by a powerful enraged woman. He conjectured that the
Rani's resentment would not be displayed in a burst of
anger, a dagger thrust openly at his breast; but in one
of those covert ways, by which such offenders as himself
were disposed of, to terrorize the stoutest heart. He
might be invited to an entertainment that led to the dungeon
of a fortress, there to die of cholera, so it would be
affirmed. Obnoxious people often disappeared without
an explanation. The blank of that unknown was fraught
with the suggestion of torture, and a lingering death by
slow poison.</p>

<p>As Ahmad glanced uneasily round the hall, every
shadow seemed to warn him of impending danger. The
palace was no safe place for him if the Rani and Prasad
were together. He had better, indeed, gain the outside of
the walls of Gwalior until he had made up his mind what
course to adopt. He rose to carry this idea into immediate
effect.</p>

<p>"What, art thou going"? his neighbor asked in a tone
of friendly rebuke. "Thou, who art ever the first in
war and the last to leave a banquet."</p>

<p>"To-morrow is a fast," Ahmad tersely rejoined. "I
would be early at my devotions."</p>

<p>His neighbor laughed banteringly.</p>

<p>"Your devotions"! he exclaimed. "Ah, to be sure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
and to a fair deity, I doubt not. It is ever the way with
you Mohammedans. Your Prophet takes good care that
his followers are provided with <i>houris</i> on earth as well
as in heaven. But good luck to you. May she speedily
reward your prayers."</p>

<p>"The fool," muttered Ahmad, as he passed from the
hall by the nearest exit. "A very yielding deity is the
one I have in mind."</p>

<p>With caution he made his way through dark passages
and courts out from the palace. He strode rapidly into
the narrow, squalid bazaars of Gwalior, directing his
steps toward one of the city gates, heedless of the rejoicings
of the people among whom he passed. He
breathed the night air more freely when he had left the
walls behind.</p>

<p>At the camp, which was his first destination, he found
the soldiers drinking in celebration of the victory, and
disposed to be quarrelsome. He approached his own
quarters and sternly ordered a few men, upon whose
temporary fidelity he could depend, to saddle their horses.
Curses and blows soon brought them to their senses and
obedience. In his tent, Ahmad quickly sorted and
placed in security about his person, the lighter and more
valuable of Sindhia's jewels that had fallen to his share.
Then he came forth, mounted his horse, and led the way
to a dwelling situated a few miles out from the city.</p>

<p>It was a house he had visited on a previous residence
in Gwalior, secluded, and within easy reach of the hills<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
in case of the necessity of flight. It was owned by a
member of his religion, who received him with every
outward sign of friendship.</p>

<p>There, he determined to remain for a day or two, and
by means of spies watch the actions of the Rani and
Prasad.</p>

<p>Such news as he did thus receive inflamed his jealousy
still further, and confirmed the surmise of danger in his
position.</p>

<p>The Rani, it appeared, had taken up her abode in the
camp, to direct the maneuvering of troops and the erection
of fortifications in the defiles of the hills against a
possible return of the enemy. Prasad was observed constantly
at her side. It was evident he had entirely regained
her favor; it was almost certain the moving hand
of the Jhansi intrigue had been detected.</p>

<p>Clearly, to Ahmad's mind, Gwalior was no safe place
in which to remain. He had better away before the
Rani's vengeance fell.</p>

<p>He argued further, that, for other reasons, a severance
of his connection with the Native cause would now be a
wise course. The jewels he had obtained from Sindhia's
treasure were of considerable value. He had taken other
booty, too, that could be turned into ready money through
the agency of his Moslem host. With this, he might
return to Afghanistan and placate the Amir, from whose
anger he had fled, consequent upon the death of a relative
of that monarch, charged to Ahmad's long account of
such affairs. Besides, what business had he to fight in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
the Peshwa's name? Had the Emperor of Delhi been
proclaimed at the <i>Darbar</i>, religious principles might have
enjoined upon him the duty of remaining in the field,
but he owed no allegiance to the Hindu king. As a fanatic,
at heart, he detested the Hindu faith and its followers.
His object had been to fight with them, first to vanquish
the Foreigners, and then, in the name of the Mogul Emperor,
subdue his allies. But that hour was now unlikely
ever to come. The Emperor was a prisoner in the Foreigners'
hands, and such power as was regained to the
Native cause through the victory of the Rani of Jhansi,
lay with the Peshwa. He despised and hated the Peshwa,
so he decided to withdraw from Gwalior, though not
alone. He purposed to carry the Rani with him by force,
if such an act were possible. He thought out his plan
deeply, for in it there was no little danger.</p>

<p>That night, he determined to ride into the camp and
direct one of his followers to seize her from her tent,
then away before an alarm could be given or a rescue
effected. It was a bold project, but he was prepared to
risk much in a last attempt to secure her embrace. If
frustrated in the act, he could lie, fight, or fly as circumstances
dictated. The chief difficulty lay in discovering
her sleeping place, as it was reported she changed her
tent nightly. Over this, he pondered, at length arriving
at the decision to decoy the Rani's secretary to his house,
and by threats compel him to disclose the secret, if it were
preserved as such. He sent forth two of his men, discreet
in such affairs, to lay hold of Bipin Dat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>As it happened this proved to be an easy matter.</p>

<p>Like the majority of the Rani's followers, Bipin had
plunged into a demonstrative celebration of good fortune.
With head held aloft and chest expanded, as he considered
was the proper carriage for one who stood so
near to the person of the Heroine of Gwalior, he had
gone forth on the morrow of the victory to impress upon
everyone he met the exalted nature of his office. He
was thus received by all with protestations of friendship,
given the best to eat, and unluckily more spirits to drink
than it was prudent for him to imbibe. Alas! For two
days the worthy secretary had been absent from his
duties.</p>

<p>In sober intervals, marvelous were the stories he recounted
of personal valor in battles fought side by side
with his great mistress. His audiences gazed upon him
with eyes wide open, as they listened with ears of deep
attention. At the conclusion of each narrative the brave
secretary must accept another cup of spirits. Of a truth
the brave secretary seemed as great a drinker as he was
a fighter. He always protested, but drank the spirits
nevertheless. At last he stumbled across an accursed
unbeliever in his prowess, one of those unpleasant people
to be found among all nations, who will persist in placing
a vocal mark of interrogation after every man's
statement.</p>

<p>"At Bahadurpur," Bipin asserted, "six of the Foreigners
I killed with this arm. Their Maharaja I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
have captured, but that he plunged with his elephant into
the jungle."</p>

<p>"How could that be"? asked the incredulous one,
"since there were no Foreigners at Bahadurpur, their
general does not ride on an elephant, and there is no
jungle within leagues of the place. To be sure what
thou sayest is doubtless true, honorable sir," he added
apologetically, "but other accounts of the battle differ
so much; and what am I, but a seeker after the exact
truth"?</p>

<p>Bipin glared angrily upon the venturesome man, but
his ideas were not in such order, just at the moment, to
discover an answer on the tip of his tongue. Fortunately,
two men who had sat attentively in a corner came to the
relief of his confusion.</p>

<p>"Thou art a miserable fellow," interposed one, addressing
the doubter. "If the great secretary says he
killed six of the Foreigners at Bahadurpur, they must
have been there to be slain. If he asserts the Foreign
general escaped on an elephant, did he not possess eyes
to note the difference between that beast and a camel.
Wert thou at the battle"? he asked pointedly.</p>

<p>"Aye, wert thou at the battle"? echoed the companion,
"otherwise thou art an ass to talk in such fashion."</p>

<p>The doubter was compelled to admit that he had not
been within miles of the fight, when the secretary's confusion
was transferred to his countenance.</p>

<p>Bipin effusively thanked his champions for their belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
in his words. In turn they insisted upon drinking a
cup of spirits with so great a man.</p>

<p>"Ah"! exclaimed the first who had spoken, "what
would not my poor master give to hear such tales as
flow from thy lips."</p>

<p>"Who is thy master"? asked Bipin, with a solemn
period between each word.</p>

<p>"The Raja Krishna Singh, great sir," the other replied
respectfully, "a Gwalior noble whose infirmities
have for long held him to his couch, and prevented his
attendance even at the grand <i>Darbar</i>. He would receive
thee with all honor as the Rani's secretary, and reward
thee handsomely if thou wouldst deign to tell all thou
knowest of the glorious Queen of Jhansi. Her name is
ever in his mind. My companion and myself would
gladly lead the way to his house."</p>

<p>Bipin's pride was immensely flattered. His society
was now being sought by a raja. Soon he would be a
raja himself. With condescension he agreed to accept
the invitation, after he had drank another cup of spirits
to steady his feet.</p>

<p>"Is it far to thy master's house"? he asked.</p>

<p>"But a short distance beyond the walls, noble Secretary,"
his new friend replied.</p>

<p>"<i>Wah!</i> Then I will go with thee now," Bipin assented.</p>

<p>He endeavored to rise, but the additional cup of spirits
had an effect contrary to what was intended. His limbs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
collapsed under him as if disjointed. He would have
been obliged to remain on the spot but for his friends'
assistance. They helped him to his feet and out into
the bazaar, then with strong arms supporting him on
either side, they hurried him to the gate.</p>

<p>For a time, Bipin chattered incoherently about battles,
rajas, and palaces; when it began to dawn upon his obscure
understanding that he was travelling a great distance.
His feet dragged over the road as if weights of
iron were chained to his ankles. He begged to be permitted
to lie down and sleep. To his dismay his companions
gruffly ordered him to move faster. It suddenly
occurred to him that he might have been abducted by
thieves.</p>

<p>He cried once for help, but a hand promptly laid over
his mouth stifled the sound. In a firm grasp he was
thrust unwillingly forward.</p>

<p>At last they came to the house occupied by Ahmad
Khan, when Bipin was conducted out of the darkness
immediately into the Mohammedan's presence.</p>

<p>For a moment the secretary stood blinking in the light
with no idea of his surroundings. He had entirely forgotten
the object with which he had been induced to set
forth from the city; but Ahmad's countenance seemed
familiar. Through a mental haze, the thought came to
him that one of his uncles had heard of his good fortune,
and had arrived to obtain a share of his money. This
was a displeasing, if not an entirely unlooked for event,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
so he determined to disavow the relationship before the
other had time to make himself known.</p>

<p>"Go away," he ejaculated, with his eyes fixed stupidly
upon Ahmad. "Go away. Thou art a rogue, a lying
<i>fakir</i>. I swear thou art no uncle of mine."</p>

<p>"What, thou drunken fool," shouted Ahmad in a voice
of thunder. "I would as soon be uncle to a litter of
swine."</p>

<p>He clutched Bipin by the throat, and held him until
the secretary's eyes and tongue protruded. Ahmad
hurled him into a corner.</p>

<p>"Get water," he cried, "and throw over the idiot.
Then, perhaps he will come to his senses."</p>

<p>But Bipin had arrived at a realization of his position.
He recognized Ahmad, and begged forgiveness for his
mistake.</p>

<p>"To be sure," he returned feebly. "Thou art my good
friend, Ahmad Khan, though a little rough and quick in
resenting an error of sight on coming in out of the darkness.
I beseech thee to say no more about the pitcher
of water."</p>

<p>"That wilt depend how quickly thou canst gather thy
wits," Ahmad sternly replied.</p>

<p>"Surely every one of them are now in my head," answered
Bipin, frightened at Ahmad's manner. While he
endeavored to recollect how it was he had been induced
to come to the place, he began to change his previous
good opinion of the Mohammedan.</p>

<p>"Then listen," enjoined Ahmad, "and speak truly or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
torch applied to thy feet may quicken thy understanding.
Dost know in which tent the Rani sleeps to-night"?</p>

<p>As Bipin had not been to the camp, he was not possessed
of the information, but under the circumstances he
thought it best to withhold his ignorance. In any case,
he reasoned, it was probable Ahmad would not place
credence on his denial, and might carry his threat of the
torch into effect.</p>

<p>"Certainly, great sir," he replied. "If it be thy desire,
I am ready to point out the Rani's tent."</p>

<p>"Where is it situated"? Ahmad asked.</p>

<p>This was a difficult question for Bipin to answer off-hand.
He hesitated a moment before he replied.</p>

<p>"Where is her tent placed"? Ahmad again demanded.</p>

<p>"Great Lord," stammered Bipin, "near to,&mdash;I mean on
the right of that occupied by her Valaiti guard."</p>

<p>"Thou art assured of this"?</p>

<p>"Noble sir, why should I tell a lie"? Bipin questioned
in return.</p>

<p>"Good, then," Ahmad resumed, bending a stern look
on the secretary. "In two hours we set forth from the
camp. When we arrive there, thou wilt point out the
Rani's tent to one of my men. If thou hast spoken the
truth, then thou canst go to the devil for aught I care; but
if a lie, the Rani will herself have thee well beaten. It is
her order that thou dost obey me in this," he added, in
response to a surprised look on the secretary's face, "as
she awaits a secret message that must fall into no other
hands."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Ahmad then withdrew to call down, as usual, the blessing
of God on his evil intent; leaving Bipin in charge
of an attendant.</p>

<p>An attempt on the secretary's part to discover Ahmad's
object further, was met by a silent repulse.</p>

<p>Truly, the situation was not one to afford the secretary
cheerful reflections. He knew no more than Ahmad of
the position of the Rani's tent, but he trusted that in the
scuffle likely to ensue, from an entry into a tent presumed
to be that of the Rani, he could escape. He had told a
lie in the first place, and was now afraid to disclose the
truth. Whatever was the result, he vowed henceforth
to transfer his watchful eye from Prasad to Ahmad, as
it was evident the Mohammedan had a disagreeable, an
unfriendly side to his nature.</p>

<p>"What a miserable existence is this," concluded Bipin.
"We have no sooner climbed to a great height, than a
rock slips from under our feet, and behold! we are again
where we started. If I only get well out of this, no
prospect shall tempt me to remain away from my family."</p>

<p>Presently the effect of the secretary's libations overcame
his fears, and snores proclaimed unconsciousness.</p>

<p>Bipin had slept for about two hours, when he was
awakened by a rough hand laid on his shoulder, while a
voice commanded him to rise immediately.</p>

<p>He was led to the outer door of the house, where a
group of horsemen, with Ahmad in their midst, were
accoutred apparently for a long march. With considerable
effort, emphasized by impatient oaths from Ahmad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
the secretary was assisted on to the back of a spare
charger. Ahmad gave an order, and the party set off at a
brisk pace through the darkness of midnight toward the
camp&mdash;silent, grim visaged figures, ready for any desperate
act.</p>

<p>Ahmad approached the camp at a point where he was
well known and would be permitted to pass unquestioned.
He inquired his way to the headquarters and rode thither
with caution. Then he ordered two of his followers to
dismount and carry out his previous directions.</p>

<p>There were no lights, and for a space Bipin stumbled
about among the tent ropes.</p>

<p>"Thou fool," muttered one of the men. "If thou
dost make such a disturbance the whole camp will be
awakened. Where is the tent? Point it out quickly and
let us get the work over, or the master will slit thy
windpipe."</p>

<p>Bipin had not the faintest idea of the Rani's sleeping
place, but he indicated a tent at random.</p>

<p>"Siva protect me," he faltered. "What now will
happen"?</p>

<p>One of the men approached the tent noiselessly and
untied the fastenings. He listened for a moment, when
being satisfied apparently that its occupant was still asleep,
entered. His companion watched outside.</p>

<p>In a minute the man reappeared bearing a struggling
woman's form in his arms, with one hand over her mouth
to prevent an outcry. He hurried to the waiting troop
and relinquished his burden to Ahmad. The two men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
then vaulted on to their horses, and the whole party were
off without a cry, or a word exchanged.</p>

<p>Bipin remained for some moments a prey to fear and
astonishment. Then it broke upon his mind that he had
betrayed his mistress for some evil purpose.</p>

<p>"Ah, hae, hae"! he cried. "Oh, wretch that I am.
Ah, the unluckiness of everything. Help! Help! good
people. The Rani has been abducted."</p>

<p>In a few seconds guards ran with all haste to the spot;
figures emerged from the tents, a babel of tongues rose
above the wail of the secretary. Presently, to Bipin's
surprise, the Rani herself appeared on the scene.</p>

<p>"What is all this"? she demanded. "Bipin art thou
intoxicated, or has thy sleep been possessed by a nightmare"?</p>

<p>"Oh, great Lady," he cried. "Tell me, I implore
thee, is it, in truth, thyself, who speakest"?</p>

<p>"To be sure," she replied. "Who else should it be.
Thou art becoming a tiresome fellow," she added, "with
thy midnight adventures. Disclose, what manner of
creature hast thou been in combat with now"?</p>

<p>"Alas! great Rani," Bipin returned. "It was the terrible
Ahmad Khan who compelled me to point out thy
sleeping place, and he has gone off with I know not
whom."</p>

<p>"Ahmad Khan"? the Rani exclaimed, as the truth of
his design flashed upon her. "Now, by Heaven"! she
cried angrily. "I will bear no more with him. Go,"
she commanded to the captain of her guard, "mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
with a troop and follow swiftly. Thou art to bring him
to me alive or dead. The beast hath gone mad and
must be exterminated."</p>

<p>The officer obeyed her order with dispatch. He rode
forth in the direction it was said Ahmad Khan had taken,
but in the darkness soon lost the track. At daybreak he
was forced to return with the intelligence that Ahmad
had escaped.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Ahmad galloped northward with savage
joy in his heart. He clasped the insensible captive form
tightly in his arms.</p>

<p>"Now Allah be thanked," he muttered exultingly.
"The fair Rani, the fickle beauty can escape me no
longer."</p>

<p>He rode with all speed for a long distance in fear of
pursuit, but at last he could restrain his impatient desire
to gaze upon her face no longer.</p>

<p>The day was breaking as he halted his party. He
moved a little apart, and uncovered the fold of linen over
the woman's head. He directed his eyes with passionate
rapture upon the unveiled face; then broke out into a
volley of oaths.</p>

<p>"Hell's fiends," he shouted, as his astonished gaze beheld
an old and wrinkled countenance. "What damnable
trick of fortune is this? Am I bewitched"?</p>

<p>His arms mechanically released the figure of an aged
servant of the Rani. She fell to the ground, and, recovering
her senses, sat moaning pitifully.</p>

<p>For a time, Ahmad was too dumbfounded to take any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
other course than to explode curse after curse. Then
his mortification and fury burst upon the heads of the
two attendants, who had been chief parties to the misadventure.
He rode at them with uplifted sword, but
they warily parried his blows, to finally disarm their
master.</p>

<p>"What will my Lord do now"? they asked significantly.</p>

<p>Truly, what would Ahmad Khan do now? was the
question. To return to the Rani's camp was impossible.
There was no choice but to go forward.</p>

<p>"Get thee home, hag," he addressed the terrified
woman, "and bear Ahmad Khan's best <i>salaams</i> to thy noble
mistress. Tell her, he hath grown weary of her court
and her caprices."</p>

<p>With fury he drove his spurs into his horse's flanks.
By night and day, with little rest, he rode for that lawless
territory beyond the Afghan border. There, his own
followers seized an opportunity to relieve him of his life
and treasure.</p>

<p>In a barren, rocky pass, his body lay, pierced by a
dozen wounds, exposed to the vulture and the lion; while
his murderers, in retreat, quarrelled and fought over the
price of their treachery.</p>

<p>It was a pitiless closing scene, in keeping with his
nature.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<i>FOR MY COUNTRY</i></h2>


<p>Gwalior was captured by the Rani of Jhansi.
Such was the astounding news carried
swiftly from end to end of the Indian Peninsula.
The Natives, for the greater part,
hailed it either with secret or open joy, many nobles, with
their retainers, hastening to join the standard of the redoutable
Princess. To the Foreigners, it brought astonishment
and perplexity, with fears that the whole rebellion
would burst forth anew. They realized that a second
Jeanne D'Arc, as valiant in battle, more subtle in council
than the Maid of Orleans, moved by the same passionate
love for her country, had cast in their teeth a wager of
defiance, to stand until either they were driven from her
state, or she had perished.</p>

<p>It was no hour for deliberation. Her <i>coup de main</i>
had been so well timed, that unless Gwalior was immediately
recaptured, the rains would descend, making the
country impassable for military operations, and her position
thus secure for months to come. The result was
unpleasant to conjecture.</p>

<p>With all haste the army of Central India, that had retired
to quarters for the approaching season of storm, was
reorganized, and the general who had fought against the
Rani at Jhansi, at Kunch, and at Kalpi, marched forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
to another test of skill. In his long and honorable career
he had never met an opposing leader more worthy of his
steel.</p>

<p>In the meantime the Rani threw all the force of her
character, all the energy of both her body and mind, into
preparations for the struggle she quickly perceived was
at hand. She fully appreciated the material advantage
she had gained, she also understood the weaknesses of
her comrades in arms&mdash;their tendency to prolong the
festivities in celebration of their victory, their unconquerable
disposition to retreat the moment the Foreigners
closed in battle. But now that she was in supreme command,
she determined that at Gwalior it would either be
another victory, or death for herself and the majority of
her companions.</p>

<p>"Canst thou not rest for a little, dear Rani"? Prasad
asked, when after days of untiring energy she continued
to bend her efforts to perfect the defenses. "If the Foreigners
come, surely we are safe from them here."</p>

<p>"Nay Prasad," she returned. "No rest will I take
while danger threatens, and this work remains uncompleted.
But in a little there will come a long rest for
me, either in thy arms, my love; or in those of God."</p>

<p>Prasad, the Rao Sahib, even Tantia Topi, through his
jealousy, marvelled at the spirit of the woman. They
curtailed their feasting, and zealously furthered her
commands.</p>

<p>The general belief that the Foreigners would not march
upon Gwalior before the rains was soon dispelled. From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
two directions, the East and South, it was learned, that
the enemy was rapidly approaching. It was evident they
regarded the recapture of Gwalior as of supreme
importance.</p>

<p>It was impossible for the Rani to superintend in person
the long line of defenses raised before Gwalior, so
she delegated the command of those to the south to Tantia
Topi, reserving for herself the less strongly fortified
position amid the hills and ravines to the south-east of
the city, lying between that place and the village of
Kotah-ki-sari. There she awaited the army advancing
from the east, impatiently for a few days; with still
greater impatience on the Sixteenth of June, when the
distant roar of cannon announced that Tantia Topi was
engaged with the Foreigners at Morar, on her extreme
right.</p>

<p>Throughout the day various reports reached her ears.
At one time, it was claimed, that the Foreigners were
successively repulsed, beaten, and in full retreat; later,
that Tantia Topi was as usual practicing masterly tactics
in a retrograde movement.</p>

<p>"Ah, now, may God curse his cowardice," she cried
passionately, to the messenger. "Return with all speed
and order him to stand wherever he may be; for if I find
him in the Gwalior fortress, one of us shall die for it."</p>

<p>But Tantia was not of standing fibre before Foreign
bayonets. If in little else, he was a genius in limbering
up his guns and dragging them away from desperate
positions. That night the Rani was informed that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
had succeeded in executing a clever strategic act. He
had held the Foreigners at bay until he was able to move
back upon Gwalior in good order with his guns, abandoning
Morar, a useless place, to the enemy. On the morrow
he believed he would rout them utterly.</p>

<p>The Rani's anger, her contempt for such conduct of
warfare, could scarcely find expression in words or action.
She sat in her tent, sick at heart, pondering deeply
over the situation.</p>

<p>"What can I do"? she murmured. "I cannot command
at all points of this wide field at the same moment.
Is there no one but me who hath the courage to dash forward?
These Foreigners are only men like ourselves.
They are not Gods. God knows, far from it. Have I
not seen many of them perish at Jhansi, at Kunch, and
at Kalpi"?</p>

<p>"Go," she commanded to an aid-de-camp. "Go to
Tantia Topi, and say that if he doth make such another
masterly retreat, the Rani of Jhansi will aid herself by
attacking him in rear, and driving him on to the enemy's
bayonets."</p>

<p>Then she retired to a temple and prayed long and fervently
to the God of Battles, that on the morrow her
troops might be endowed with invincible courage, that
once more He would give her arms a victory.</p>

<p>The day broke with an atmosphere charged with
sweltering heat. Soon the rocks and sand burned to the
touch as if but a thin crust lay between their feet and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
mighty furnace. If its oppressiveness was felt by the
Rani's troops, it bore tenfold more heavily upon the Foreigners,
fatigued by a long march.</p>

<p>The Rani had taken up a position with cavalry, artillery
and infantry among the hills intervening between
the enemy and the plain of Gwalior. Her plan was to
draw the Foreigners into the ravines by a feint of retreat,
holding them there in conflict with intrenched infantry
and masked batteries, while she swept down with
her cavalry through a flank defile upon their rear. She
might thus capture their baggage and ammunition train,
throwing their front into hopeless confusion.</p>

<p>At daybreak she beheld the enemy advance to the
assault.</p>

<p>All through that day the battle was waged with desperate
valor on both sides. Step by step the Foreigners
fought their way into the ravines, driving the Native
troops before them. At different stages the Rani rode
into the thick of the combat to animate her followers,
with Prasad bearing her standard. Her counter attack
was delivered at an opportune moment, but was frustrated.
Evening approached to find both armies
exhausted, the Rani's first position captured, but her forces
still held well together. A decisive victory could not as
yet be claimed by either side; for the Rani had decided
to continue the battle throughout the night.</p>

<p>It was in a moment of temporary rest, that the Foreign
general ordered his cavalry to charge, with the object of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
driving the Rani's bodyguard out into the Gwalior plain.
The movement took the latter by surprise, with a resulting
panic.</p>

<p>The Rani bravely fronted the oncoming squadrons in
an endeavor to rally her troopers, but in the tumult her
horse took the bit in its teeth and carried her away in
the rout. At their heels the Foreign horsemen were
slashing and firing their pistols mercilessly. Again and
again the Rani called on her troopers to halt, but they
only rode for the camp the faster. She reined in her horse
and turned, to find she was the last on that part of the
field. A hussar was upon her with uplifted sword.</p>

<p>The blow fell but she parried it adroitly, and delivered
another in return that slightly wounded her assailant.
More hussars coming fast in their leader's wake, the
odds were too uneven against her. She set her horse
at a ditch a few yards in front, beyond which was safety.
The brute urged by her voice leaped forward to the bank,
then refused to jump, stumbled and fell with its rider.
Before she could extricate herself, the hussar dashed
upon her with fury nettled by the pain of his wound.
As he swept by, he leveled his pistol and fired. The
bullet lodged in her breast, her sword fell from her hand,
she sank to the ground in unconsciousness to rise no
more.</p>

<p>Over the ditch the hussar passed little thinking that he
had dealt a mortal wound to the "bravest and best" of
the Native leaders. In his eyes she had appeared only
as one of their officers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon the Foreigners' bugles sounded the recall, the
Rani's bodyguard rallied and charged back over the field,
but it was too late to save their mistress. They discovered
her where she had fallen, and gently, sadly, bore
her back to her tent.</p>

<p>There it was made apparent that her end was quickly
approaching. Prasad, heartbroken, bitterly reproached
himself that he had not remained at her side to protect
her from harm. He had taken her lifeless form in his
arms. About them were grouped men who had never
before experienced a tender emotion. Tears coursed
down their fierce, bronzed, visages.</p>

<p>Prasad's gentle caresses at last recalled the Rani to
consciousness.</p>

<p>"Well Prasad," she asked in a faint voice. "How
went the battle? All is not lost I hope, though I am
wounded to the death."</p>

<p>"Ah, dear one," he sadly returned. "All is truly lost
with thee."</p>

<p>"Do not speak thus," she replied, painfully exerting
herself to a return of spirit. "While brave men live no
cause is lost."</p>

<p>Then turning her gaze upon the grief stricken countenances
of her troopers, she enjoined them not to weep
for her.</p>

<p>"For thy tears will bring forth mine," she pleaded,
"and the true soldier cries not on facing death."</p>

<p>With assistance, she then removed Sindhia's necklace
from her breast. She directed the strings to be broken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
and summoning her ever faithful Valaitis gave to each,
in turn, a pearl in remembrance of their fair captain.</p>

<p>"Farewell," she said, as each saluted with uncontrolled
grief. "Be brave and fight on until the end."</p>

<p>Soon Prasad remained with her alone.</p>

<p>For a time she rested her head upon his breast with
her arms about him. Many loving, sorrowful words
were exchanged, until she felt the moment of dissolution
nigh.</p>

<p>"Prasad," she said. "Place thy hand within my
jacket. Thou wilt find my parting gift to thee there."</p>

<p>He obeyed as she directed, and drew forth his dagger.</p>

<p>"Thy dagger, O Prasad," she exclaimed. "I have
kept it to protect my honor. I give it back to thee to
save thine own in case of need. And now, my dear
Lord, one request have I to ask of thee before I say
farewell. I beg thou wilt see to it, that no Foreign eye
doth gaze upon my body after I am dead."</p>

<p>In a sorrowful whisper he promised to comply.</p>

<p>"Then farewell," she said. "Farewell Prasad, may
God love thee as truly as I have done."</p>

<p>"Farewell"? he exclaimed interrogatively. "I will
not leave thee yet alone."</p>

<p>"Prasad," she returned. "It is my will to be alone.
Nay, I shall not be alone. Again I say, farewell to thee,
for thine eyes must not behold my last moment."</p>

<p>He embraced her once more, laid her gently back amid
the pillows, then rose obediently to her command. He
paused on the threshold of the entrance to gaze for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
last time upon her face. In its beautiful features there
was discernible neither sign of weakness nor of fear&mdash;her
spirit remained heroic to the end. He covered his
eyes with his hands and passed forth.</p>

<p>Within the tent a profound, mysterious, silence fell, as
the darkness of night descended on the land. The Rani
clasped her hands upon her breast as her lips murmured
a last prayer.</p>

<p>"Great God of Gods. O most holy, omnipotent One.
If I have sinned against the laws of my caste, it was for
the love of my country. Surely thou wilt forgive a woman
who has tried to inspire others to be brave and just.
O India," she cried, raising herself with difficulty upon
her side and stretching forth her arms, "farewell. Farewell
my people, my brave soldiers whom I have loved to
lead in battle against the foe. Not forever shall their
horsemen ride triumphantly through the land. A day
will come when their law shall be no longer obeyed, and
our temples and palaces rise anew from their ruins.
Farewell! Farewell! O Gods of my fathers, be with
me now."</p>

<p>She drew the folds of a shawl over her face to hide
her death agony, and again lay down. The blackness of
night grew deeper, the silence more intense. Presently,
strange, warrior forms seemed to appear from the unknown
and filled the Rani's tent. One supremely beautiful
figure, in dazzling raiment, came forth to enfold the
dying woman in her arms.</p>

<p>In a little, a wail of lamentation rose across the intervening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
space between the camps of the two armies. The
Foreign soldiers asked its meaning of one another.</p>

<p>The answer might have been, that the spirit of the
heroic Lachmi Bai had been gathered to the protecting
arms of Param-eswara, the merciful, the just, the all
supreme God, alike of the Hindu, the Mohammedan, and
the Christian.</p>

<p>The Rani of Jhansi was dead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Great was the pomp and solemn the ceremony with
which they carried out her last desire, so that even her
body might not fall into the hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>Before the day had come again, a long procession took
its way from Sindhia's palace to a point on the bank of
the Morar river, where a flower-decked funeral pyre had
been erected.</p>

<p>In the van troopers marched with mournful step, followed
by officers bearing torches. Then came Brahman
priests, naked to the waist in performance of their sacred
office. They chanted from the Vedas and scattered rice
upon the way. These preceded the bier, upon which,
under a canopy of cloth of gold, lay the body of the Rani,
attired in royal robes, with the marks of her high caste
set upon her forehead. Directly following, walked her
aged <i>guru</i>, whose solemn duty it would be, in the absence
of a relative, to ignite the funeral pyre. Lastly, Prasad
with the Rao Sahib, attended by all the nobles of the
court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>Beside the whole length of the route traversed by the
procession, a multitude of people had gathered, whose
lamentations rent the air.</p>

<p>The bier was carried slowly to its destination, and
seven times round the funeral pyre. Then the Rani's body
was lifted tenderly and placed upon its last bed of death,
rice was scattered over all, and the dry brush, saturated
with <i>ghee</i>, ignited.</p>

<p>The flames leaped high, illuminating many weeping
faces, and throwing into relief the figures of Brahmans,
nobles, and officers, grouped in a majestic scene. Quickly
the tongues of fire reduced to ashes the Rani's mortal
form. These, the priests reverentially collected, and,
with prayers, cast them upon the waters of the river, to
be carried into the bosom of holy Ganges.</p>

<p>"Farewell," cried Prasad, as he stood upon the bank.
"Farewell, thou brave, dear Rani. I doubt not I shall
be with thee soon."</p>

<p>That day the sun of India hid its face behind gathering
clouds, the storm, the monsoon burst.</p>

LORDS OF THE NORTH<br />
</b></big>
<br />
<span class="smcap">By A. C. LAUT</span><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">A Strong Historical Novel</span><br />
</div>

<blockquote>

<p><i>LORDS OF THE NORTH</i> is a thrilling romance
dealing with the rivalries and intrigues of <i>The Ancient
and Honorable Hudson's Bay</i> and the <i>North-West
Companies</i> for the supremacy of the fur trade in the
Great North. It is a story of life in the open; of
pioneers and trappers. The life of the fur traders in
Canada is graphically depicted. The struggles of the Selkirk
settlers and the intrigues which made the life of the two great
fur trading companies so full of romantic interest, are here
laid bare. <i>Francis Parkman</i> and other historians have
written of the discovery and colonization of this part of our
great North American continent, but no novel has appeared
so full of life and vivid interest as <i>Lords of the North</i>.
Much valuable information has been obtained from old
documents and the records of the rival companies which wielded
unlimited power over a vast extent of our country. The
style is admirable, and the descriptions of an untamed continent,
of vast forest wastes, rivers, lakes and prairies, will
place this book among the foremost historical novels of the
present day. The struggles of the English for supremacy,
the capturing of frontier posts and forts, and the life of trader
and trapper are pictured with a master's hand. Besides
being vastly interesting, <i>Lords of the North</i> is a book of historical
value.</p>

"Without question the best book for young girls which has appeared
for years. Besides being interesting it has an educational value, as it is good
supplementary reading to a school course in history. Mrs. Barr is at her
best in <i>Trinity Bells</i>. We trust that every library will soon have a copy on
its shelves."</p>

<p><b>LITERARY WORLD, Boston.</b>
"In idea and execution this is one of the author's best works, and
well worthy of its superb dress of silver and green."</p>

<p><b>THE BOOK-BUYER.</b>
"The name is happily chosen for this romantic story of life in New
York during the period preceding the war with the Mediterranean corsairs,
for the bells of Old Trinity ring out an accompaniment to the changing fortunes
of the lovable little Dutch heroine. There is a charm in Mrs. Barr's
work that goes directly to the reader's heart, while her skill in the delineation
of character is no less effective in its appeal to the mind. <i>Trinity Bells</i>
is an excellent minor historical romance, worthy of a permanent place in a
young girl's library."</p>

<p><b>BOSTON TIMES.</b>
"No more agreeable story of life in the early days of our country has
ever been written. <i>Trinity Bells</i> shows Mrs. Barr's charm and power in
all its force and beauty. Besides its historical value, it is vastly entertaining."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Parlous Times is a society novel of to-day.
The scene is laid in London in diplomatic
circles. The romance was suggested by
experiences of the author while Second Secretary of
the United States Embassy at the Court of St.
James. It is a charming love story, with a
theme both fresh and attractive. The plot is
strong, and the action of the book goes with a
rush. Political conspiracy and the secrets of
an old tower of a castle in Sussex play an
important part in the novel. The story is a
bright comedy, full of humor, flashes of keen
wit and clever epigram. It will hold the
reader's attention from beginning to end.
Altogether it is a good story exceedingly well
told, and promises to be Mr. Wells' most
successful novel.</p>
